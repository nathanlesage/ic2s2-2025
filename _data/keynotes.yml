  title: "Understanding Influence - a Network Science + AI approach"
  chair_name: TBA
  date: TBA
  abstract: |
    The US National Academy in its decadal survey of the Social Sciences argued that today we are in an era of Networks+.  In other words, rarely do people use social network or network science techniques in isolation; rather, these are augmented with other computationally based techniques such as computational linguistics and machine learning.  In the area of social-cybersecurity, a field concerned with identifying, characterizing and mitigating online harms such as undue influence, disinformation, hate-speech and extremism, network science is frequently combined with various AI techniques to build more effective tools to support interventions, to improve imperial analysis, and to simulate behavior. A particular area of concern is influence, that is "who is influencing whom on line, how and to what effect?".  The BEND framework has been proposed as a way of systematically characterising such information operations, and it has been operationalized using network science + AI techniques in a way that enables the analyst in detecting, characterizing, mitigating, and assessing the impact of influence activities, those being influenced, and the influencer.  In this presentation the BEND framework and its operationalization using network science+AI  will be described.  Then the insights that can be drawn using this approach will be illustrated using data from various events around the world. The presentation with a call for future research and an itemization of limitations and gaps where new techniques and additional research are needed.

  # field: Technology and Urban Planning
  title: "Data Action: Using Data for a Public Good"
  chair_name: TBA
  date: TBA
  abstract: |
    Williams will explain how we can use data as a tool for empowerment rather than oppression, something Williams calls "Data Action," which is also the title of her recent book. Data Action seeks to provide guidance for using data toward the benefit of society, learning from the ways we have used data unethically in the past and illustrating ways we can use it more ethically and creatively in the future. Williams will illustrate the seven Data Action principles through her diverse research projects spanning topics of Central American migration, popular transit in Africa, ghost cities in China, and translating New York City’s zoning text. Williams will also show her most recent work on People Powered AI: How to use Gen AI for Civic Engagement.
