# Any line here is a page that will NOT be included in the final output. If a
# line is commented out (that is, there is a pound-symbol (#) in front of it),
# this means the page will be included in the output. If there is no #-symbol,
# the page will be excluded, that is, cannot be found on the website. Once you
# start working on a new website, most of these lines should be un-commented,
# and once the conference approaches, all should be commented.
