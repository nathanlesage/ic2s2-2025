          The International Conference on Computational Social Science (IC2S2)
          is the premier conference, bringing together researchers interested in
          using computational and data-intensive methods to solve problems
          relevant to society. IC2S2 hosts academics and practitioners in
          computational science, complexity, network science, and social
          science, providing a platform for new research in the field of
          computational social science. Researchers across disciplines, faculty,
          graduate students, industry researchers, policy makers, and nonprofit
          workers are all encouraged to submit computational data-driven
          research and innovative computational methodological or theoretical
          contributions on social phenomena for consideration.
        </p>
