        <p>
          We welcome submissions on any topic in the field of computational
          social science, including (a) work that advances methods and
          approaches for computational social science, (b) data-driven work that
          describes and discovers social and cultural phenomena or explains and
          estimates relations between them and other things, and (c) theoretical
          work that generates new insights, connections and frameworks for
          computational social science research. Researchers across disciplines,
          faculty, graduate students, industry researchers, policy makers, and
          nonprofit workers are all encouraged to submit computational data-
          driven research and innovative computational methodological or
          theoretical contributions on social phenomena for consideration.
