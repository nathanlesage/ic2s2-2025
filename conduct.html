    <p>
      The IC2S2 community is committed to fostering a community that recognizes
      the inherent worth of every person and group, that promotes understanding
      and mutual respect, and that embraces diversity. We are thus dedicated to
      providing a harassment-free experience for all participants at our
      conference. The policy is not intended to inhibit challenging scientific
      debate, but rather to promote it through ensuring that all are welcome to
      participate in a shared spirit of scientific inquiry.

      Harassment and hostile behavior are unwelcome at any conference or event
      sponsored, co-sponsored, or organized as part of IC2S2. This includes
      speech or behavior that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes
      with a person's participation or opportunity for participation in a
      conference or an event. We aim for all IC2S2-related activities to be free
      of harassment, including but not limited to: harassment based on race,
      ethnicity, gender, religion, age, color, physical appearance, national
      origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, and
      socio-economic background. Harassment includes, among other actions,
      degrading verbal comments, discriminatory jokes and language, deliberate
      intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate
      physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

      It is the responsibility of the community as a whole to promote an
      inclusive and positive environment for our scholarly activities. Anyone
      who experiences harassment or hostile behavior may contact the IC2S2's
      Climate Liaison. During events sponsored or organized by the conference,
      this email (and an additional phone number distributed before the
      conference) will be continuously monitored for the duration of the event.
      When taking a personal report, our staff will ensure that no one can
      overhear. They may involve other event staff to ensure the report is
      managed properly. We will keep any contact in strict confidence, and those
      who contact the Climate Liaison will be consulted before any actions are
      taken.
