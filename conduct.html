      The IC2S2 community is committed to fostering a community that recognizes
      the inherent worth of every person and group, that promotes understanding
      and mutual respect, and that embraces diversity. We are thus dedicated to
      providing a harassment-free experience for all participants at our
      conference. The policy is not intended to inhibit challenging scientific
      debate, but rather to promote it through ensuring that all are welcome to
      participate in a shared spirit of scientific inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harassment and hostile behavior are unwelcome at any conference or event
      sponsored, co-sponsored, or organized as part of IC2S2. This includes
      speech or behavior that intimidates, creates discomfort, or interferes
      with a person's participation or opportunity for participation in a
      conference or an event. We aim for all IC2S2-related activities to be free
      of harassment, including but not limited to: harassment based on race,
      ethnicity, gender, religion, age, color, physical appearance, national
      origin, ancestry, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, and
      socio-economic background. Harassment includes, among other actions,
      degrading verbal comments, discriminatory jokes and language, deliberate
      intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate
      physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

      It is the responsibility of the community as a whole to promote an
      inclusive and positive environment for our scholarly activities. Anyone
      who experiences or observes harassment or hostile behavior may contact the
      IC2S2's Awareness Liaison via the contact information provided during the
      conference.
