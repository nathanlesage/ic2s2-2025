2025-07-21 09:00:00,2025-07-21 12:30:00,single,LLM Power To The People,"This tutorial aims to provide an up-to-date overview of the applications of large language models (LLMs) in research, with a particular focus on key areas such as fine-grained text classification, information extraction, and text clustering. To this end, it will cover fundamental concepts, including zero-shot learning, fine-tuning, encoder-decoder architectures, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), while also presenting various types of language models and their respective affordances. Drawing on the most recent discussions in the field, the tutorial will offer guidance on developing efficient processing pipelines, taking into consideration the computational resources available to researchers. Participants will gain practical knowledge through a combination of theoretical discussions and hands-on case studies. The session will feature Jupyter notebooks and an open-source software interface to demonstrate project implementation, including text preparation, annotation, fine tuning, inference. Additionally, attendees will receive reusable scripts to facilitate replication and adaptation in their own research projects. Beyond technical considerations, the tutorial will address the computational and annotation requirements associated with LLMs, as well as the environmental costs of different models. By integrating theoretical insights with practical implementation strategies, the session aims to delineate what is currently achievable with LLMs, what challenges persist, and what remains speculative. As a follow-up to a previous IC2S2 tutorial (2023), this session has been updated to reflect recent advancements. It will cater to both advanced and less advanced programmers, helping researchers choose the most suitable approach for their work. ","Étienne Ollion, Émilien Schultz",TBA1,,,,
2025-07-21 09:00:00,2025-07-21 12:30:00,single,"The Role of AI in Misinformation: Current Trends, Detection, and Mitigation","As AI-generated content becomes more prevalent, understanding its role within the broader misinformation landscape is critical. The widespread proliferation of misinformation in combination with the rise of AI technologies poses challenges across domains: Concerns persist that, for example, Large Language Models (LLMs) or deepfake systems have a negative impact on the creation and amplification of false or misleading information. While there are debates within the research community on the extent of AI influence on misinformation development, the challenges posed by misinformation are amplified as social media platforms increasingly dismantle traditional guardrails like fact-checking. These shifts demand interdisciplinary research to explore not only how AI contributes to the spread of misinformation but also how it can serve as a tool to better understand and combat it. Situating AI-generated misinformation within the wider context of existing dynamics highlights the urgency of addressing its impact across domains, both in science and politics, particularly as societal polarization deepens. Participants will gain hands-on experience analyzing misinformation-related datasets using natural language processing and network analysis. The tutorial emphasizes practical applications by providing coding exercises in a Jupyter notebook environment for detecting and simulating the spread of misinformation.","Miriam Schirmer, Julia Mendelsohn, Dustin Wright, Dietram A.

2025-07-21 09:00:00,2025-07-21 12:30:00,single,FAIR theory: Applying Open Science Printiples to the Construction and Iterative Improvement of Theories,"Reproducibility is essential for establishing trust and maximizing reusability of empirically calibrated simulations and other computational social science studies. Participants learn to make research projects open and reproducible according to the FAIR principles and TOP-guidelines. The workshop first establishes the fundamental principles of reproducible science, followed by a 10-minute live demonstration of creating a reproducible project using the `worcs` R-package, which streamlines the creation of reproducible projects. WORCS is easy to learn for beginners while also being highly extendable and compliant with most institutional and journal requirements. Next, topics essential for computational social science are addressed: random seeds, parallelization, integration testing to catch errors before running time-consuming analyses, and combining worcs with “targets” to reduce redundant computation, saving time and reducing the computational studies’ climate footprint. Participants are encouraged to bring their own code – e.g., for a simulation study, or to use sample code provided by the organizer. Q&A and Discussion sections ensure that the tutorial’s content aligns with participants’ needs, while guided demonstrations and hands-on exercises allow participants to develop the experience and skills needed to implement open reproducible workflows in their future research. Participants should bring a laptop and complete this setup tutorial before joining the workshop:",Caspar van Lissa,TBA3,,,,
2025-07-21 09:00:00,2025-07-21 12:30:00,single,Scalable analysis of GPs human mobility data with applications to socio-spatial inequality,"Large-scale human mobility datasets derived from mobile phones have become a valuable resource in the field of human mobility. They have found diverse applications in tasks such as travel demand estimation, urban planning, epidemic modelling, and more. However, these datasets remain largely inaccessible to the broader community due, in part, to the technical difficulties in processing these massive datasets and the comprehensive understanding of data bias and potential. In this tutorial, we will first introduce an open-source library of code from the NOMAD project (Network for Open Mobility Analysis and Datasets) as a tool to overcome the technical challenges of processing massive data sets. In the second part, we will demonstrate a critical application of human mobility analysis - socio-spatial inequality developed in realTRIPS projects (EvALuating Land Use and TRansport Impacts on Urban Mobility Patterns). The analysis provides an understanding of differences in how social phenomena play out across neighbourhoods, regions, and sociodemographic groups. Overall, we aim to demonstrate reproducible and widely applicable research methods. The library used for part of the analysis, built on Python and Spark, is designed to process this class of data at scale and implements a broad range of processing algorithms which will be employed for this particular application","Jorge Barreras, Thomas Li, Chen Zhong, Cate Heine, Adam (Zhengzi) Zhou",TBA4,,,,
2025-07-21 09:00:00,2025-07-21 12:30:00,single,Reinforcement Learning and Evolutionary Game Theory are Two Sides of the Same Coin,"Assuming that individuals are rational is often unjustified in many social and biological systems, even for simple pairwise interactions. As such, in many real-world multi-agent systems, the goal is shifted towards the understanding of the complex ecologies of behaviours emerging from a given dilemma (or ”game”). This is where evolutionary game theory (EGT) shines as a theoretical and computational framework. Likewise, from the computational perspective, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) models how self-interested agents learn and improve their policies through the accumulation of rewards coming from their past experience. Just like strategies in evolutionary game theory adapting to one another, agents’ actions evolve based on their empirical returns. The similarity is no coincidence. In this tutorial we show how these two frameworks, although applied in different context, are two sides of the same coin, presenting fundamen-tal mathematical results that demonstrate how the equilibria of population dynamics can be encoded by simple RL agents policies and the other way round. We will provide use-cases in which each modelling framework is useful. This tutorial will help the social science practitioner acquire new tools coming from AI and complex systems, and computer science practitioners to understand their research in terms of economic models.","Paolo Turrini, Elias Fernández Domingos",TBA5,,,,

2025-07-21 13:30:00,2025-07-21 17:00:00,single,Bridging Human and LLM Annotations for Statistically Valid Computational Social Science,"The tutorial provides participants with a practical, hands-on experience in integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and human annotations to streamline annotation workflows, ensuring both efficiency and statistical rigor. As LLMs revolutionize data annotation with their ability to label and analyze complex social phenomena at unprecedented scales, they also pose challenges in ensuring the reliability and validity of results. This tutorial introduces a systematic approach to combining LLM annotations with human input, enabling researchers to optimize annotation processes while maintaining rigorous standards for statistical inference. The session begins by framing the opportunities and challenges of leveraging LLMs for Computational Social Science (CSS). The tutorial demonstrates techniques for combining LLM annotations with human annotations to ensure statistically valid results while minimizing annotation costs. Through hands-on implementation using open-source datasets and code notebooks, participants will apply these methods to popular CSS tasks, such as stance detection, media bias, and online hate and misinformation. Additionally, the session will explore how these approaches can be adapted to other domains, such as psychology, sociology, and political science. By the end of the session, participants will gain actionable skills for reliably leveraging LLMs for data annotation in their own research.","Kristina Gligoric, Cinoo Lee, Tijana Zrnic",TBA1,,,,
2025-07-21 13:30:00,2025-07-21 17:00:00,single,Planetary Causal Inference: an R tutorial on how to conduct causal inference with satellite images data,"This R tutorial is based on our book-in-progress, Planetary Causal Inference (PCI), which proposes using Earth observation (EO) data to enhance social science research by expanding both the scope and resolution of data analysis. Traditional data sources like surveys and national statistics are often expensive, limited in coverage, and rarely provide real-time insights—challenges that hinder comprehensive planetary-scale studies. In contrast, satellite-based EO data offer fine-grained, global perspectives on phenomena such as urban growth, poverty, deforestation, and conflict, capturing information across diverse spatial and temporal scales. This tutorial introduces the emerging practice of EO-based machine learning (EO-ML), where advanced models transform satellite-derived spatial data into proxies for social science metrics and feed these into causal inference pipelines. By integrating knowledge from geography, history, and multi-level frameworks, PCI fosters a broader understanding of human–environment interactions, helping researchers address questions that span household, neighborhood, regional, and global contexts. Through its cookbook-style presentation of “ingredients” (data, methods) and “recipes” (analysis steps), PCI equips social scientists to confidently adopt and adapt EO-ML tools. This approach helps generate highly detailed insights and enables researchers to explore pressing global issues—ranging from armed conflict to sustainable development—with new analytical power and precision.

2025-07-21 13:30:00,2025-07-21 17:00:00,single,Research Cartography with Atlas,"Scientific inquiry depends on ""standing on the shoulders of giants"" — building on the findings of prior work. However integrating knowledge across many papers is challenging and unreliable. Papers may use terms differently, or leverage different terms to describe the same thing. Further, papers may over emphasis an outcome, or may not describe research activity with enough detail to fully understand what was measured. All these challenges, and many more make understanding the complete landscape of a research area almost impossible. Atlas, an open source platform, tackles this problem by emphasizing commensurability—the practice of describing research findings in ways that enable valid comparisons. Instead of relying solely on persuasive narratives, Atlas systematically codes experimental attributes, from detailed methodology to condition-specific distinctions. This process shifts the focus to what researchers actually do, rather than merely what they claim, making the integration of diverse studies more reliable. We will demonstrate how Atlas transforms research papers into a series of quantified dimensions, producing what we refer to as research cartography. Through guided exercises, you will learn to apply Atlas to your own projects, analyzing multiple levels of data within a single study. Our goal is to show how this method enhances transparency and reliability in scientific conclusions, ultimately advancing progress by enabling evidence-based insights that are both rigorous and comparable.","Mark Whiting, Linnea Gandhi, Amirhossein Nakhaei, Duncan Watts",TBA3,,,,
2025-07-21 13:30:00,2025-07-21 17:00:00,single,Mobility Flows and Accessibility Using R and Big Open Data,"Large-scale human mobility datasets provide unprecedented opportunities to analyze movement patterns, generating critical insights for many fields of research. Until recently, access to human mobility data was a privilege of a few researchers. Thanks to countries like Spain that pioneered to make high resolution aggregated human mobility data open, such data is becoming increasingly accessible, and similar mobility data may soon be widely available as part of official statistics across the European Union. However, the complexity and sheer volume of this data present practical challenges related to data acquisition, efficient processing, geographic disaggregation, network representation, and interactive visualization. The workshop addresses these challenges by showcasing end-to-end workflows that harness state-of-the-art R packages and methods. Participants will learn how to acquire and manage multi-gigabyte mobility datasets on consumer level laptops, combine and compare the actual mobility flows and the access to opportunities, and create informative mobility flows visualizations. Spanish open mobility data is used as a case study. This data contains anonymized and grouped flows between more than 3500 locations in Spain with hourly intervals across 3 full years. Thanks to the inclusion of several demographic variables, this data presents a universe of opportunities for analysis and research questions to explore.","Egor Kotov, Johannes Mast",TBA4,,,,

Computational social-cognitive models can be used to deduce the efficacy of potential training or educational interventions to promote sustainable practices. Tutorial attendees will learn to use the socmod library to create their own models of social learning and social influence to predict the relative success of different intervention strategies. Sustainability motivates this work, but the framework could be used to model related social and behavioral contexts.","Matthew A. Turner, James Holland Jones",TBA5,,,,

This often requires much larger or otherwise much more informative studies. It also requires choices of how to quantify effects. What relationship do various such quantifications have to scientific knowledge and, of particular relevance in applied work, to decisions? Using some examples from our recent experiments and other prominent, recent studies, I highlight how some effect size measures are typically decision-irrelevant and do not facilitate gaining generalizable knowledge. I also examine how we can use relevance to decisions to help select quantities of interest in the context of interventions in networks.",Dean Eckles,Flygeln,,,,
2025-07-22 09:45:00,2025-07-22 10:30:00,keynote,Computational analysis of social and organizational systems,"The US National Academy in its decadal survey of the Social Sciences argued that today we are in an era of Networks+.  In other words, rarely do people use social network or network science techniques in isolation; rather, these are augmented with other computationally based techniques such as computational linguistics and machine learning.  In the area of social-cybersecurity, a field concerned with identifying, characterizing and mitigating online harms such as undue influence, disinformation, hate-speech and extremism, network science is frequently combined with various AI techniques to build more effective tools to support interventions, to improve imperial analysis, and to simulate behavior. A particular area of concern is influence, that is ""who is influencing whom on line, how and to what effect?"".  The BEND framework has been proposed as a way of systematically characterising such information operations, and it has been operationalized using network science + AI techniques in a way that enables the analyst in detecting, characterizing, mitigating, and assessing the impact of influence activities, those being influenced, and the influencer.  In this presentation the BEND framework and its operationalization using network science+AI  will be described.  Then the insights that can be drawn using this approach will be illustrated using data from various events around the world.

However, they will be of most use to political and social science researchers when they are used in a way that advances understanding about real human behaviors and concerns. To promote the scientific use of LLMs, we suggest that researchers in the political and social sciences need to remain focused on the scientific goal of inference. To this end, we discuss the challenges and opportunities related to scientific inference with LLMs, using validation of model output as an illustrative case for discussion. We propose a set of guidelines related to establishing the failure and success of LLMs when completing particular tasks, and discuss how we can make inferences from these observations. We conclude with a discussion of how this refocus will improve the accumulation of shared scientific knowledge about these tools and their uses in the social sciences.",Lisa P. Argyle,Flygeln,,,,
2025-07-23 09:00:00,2025-07-23 09:45:00,keynote,Why Qualitative Research Needs Computational Social Science,"Computational methods are playing a larger role in qualitative social science, but often with the goal of scaling or automating qualitative inquiry. Scaling and automating approaches are rooted in quantitative traditions, which are focused on measurement, generalizability, and evaluation against fixed benchmarks. But qualitative research is grounded in a different logic. It aims to understand meaning, context, and how people experience the world differently depending on their social position. This talk argues that if we want to use computational methods for qualitative research, we need to develop them differently than the current approach. For example, while machine learning is often framed as a tool for classification, its strength in identifying emergent patterns in large amounts of qualitative data aligns with inductive and abductive reasoning long used in qualitative research. Evaluating classification algorithms against a pre-determined ""ground truth"" stunts their development for inductive/abductive exploration and qualitative logics. In this talk I will share examples of how computational tools can support qualitative goals—not by making qualitative work more quantitative, but by shifting how we build, evaluate, and use these tools. This includes recognizing multiple perspectives in the data, treating researchers as active interpreters, and developing criteria that reflect qualitative rather than quantitative values.",Laura Nelson,Flygeln,,,,

People occupying different cultural positions often interpret the same realities in different ways. Recent advances in computational linguistics now make it possible to systematically measure these divergent interpretations at scale. In this talk, I introduce the Categorization-Association model of interpretation—a framework for capturing shared interpretation as well as processes of interpretive coordination and divergence. Drawing on computational analyses across multiple cultural domains—from American politics to popular understandings of leisure, work, and artificial intelligence—I show how culture reveals a fractured or ""broken"" geometry of meaning. This work illustrates how computational methods can help deepen our sociological understanding of culture, while underscoring the importance of grounding computational social science in robust theory.",Amir Goldberg,Flygeln,,,,
2025-07-23 17:15:00,2025-07-23 18:00:00,keynote,Luck and success in millions of life courses,This talk probes the role luck and success in the life course. We ask whether when people get lucky the trajectory of their life success increasingly diverges from that of their unlucky counterpart. We study this question theoretically using basic models of positive feedback. Empirically we look at the lives of thousands of Americans tracked in panel survey data and millions of Swedes captured in register data. We focus on income as measure of success and study a host of different ways by which people might be lucky or unlucky at different stages of the life course. We use causal identification strategies to isolate pairs of egos and alteregos who led similarly lives before the event and then compare their life courses afterwards.,Arnout van de Rijt,Flygeln,,,,
