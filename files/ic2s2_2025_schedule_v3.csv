2025-07-21 09:00:00,2025-07-21 12:30:00,single,Tutorial 1: LLM Power To The People,"This tutorial aims to provide an up-to-date overview of the applications of large language models (LLMs) in research, with a particular focus on key areas such as fine-grained text classification, information extraction, and text clustering. To this end, it will cover fundamental concepts, including zero-shot learning, fine-tuning, encoder-decoder architectures, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), while also presenting various types of language models and their respective affordances. Drawing on the most recent discussions in the field, the tutorial will offer guidance on developing efficient processing pipelines, taking into consideration the computational resources available to researchers. Participants will gain practical knowledge through a combination of theoretical discussions and hands-on case studies. The session will feature Jupyter notebooks and an open-source software interface to demonstrate project implementation, including text preparation, annotation, fine tuning, inference. Additionally, attendees will receive reusable scripts to facilitate replication and adaptation in their own research projects. Beyond technical considerations, the tutorial will address the computational and annotation requirements associated with LLMs, as well as the environmental costs of different models. By integrating theoretical insights with practical implementation strategies, the session aims to delineate what is currently achievable with LLMs, what challenges persist, and what remains speculative. As a follow-up to a previous IC2S2 tutorial (2023), this session has been updated to reflect recent advancements. It will cater to both advanced and less advanced programmers, helping researchers choose the most suitable approach for their work. ","Étienne Ollion, Émilien Schultz",Vingen 1+2,,,,

The widespread proliferation of misinformation in combination with the rise of AI technologies poses challenges across domains: Concerns persist that, for example, Large Language Models (LLMs) or deepfake systems have a negative impact on the creation and amplification of false or misleading information. While there are debates within the research community on the extent of AI influence on misinformation development, the challenges posed by misinformation are amplified as social media platforms increasingly dismantle traditional guardrails like fact-checking. These shifts demand interdisciplinary research to explore not only how AI contributes to the spread of misinformation but also how it can serve as a tool to better understand and combat it. Situating AI-generated misinformation within the wider context of existing dynamics highlights the urgency of addressing its impact across domains, both in science and politics, particularly as societal polarization deepens. Participants will gain hands-on experience analyzing misinformation-related datasets using natural language processing and network analysis. The tutorial emphasizes practical applications by providing coding exercises in a Jupyter notebook environment for detecting and simulating the spread of misinformation.","Miriam Schirmer, Julia Mendelsohn, Dustin Wright, Dietram A.

Participants learn to make research projects open and reproducible according to the FAIR principles and TOP-guidelines. The workshop first establishes the fundamental principles of reproducible science, followed by a 10-minute live demonstration of creating a reproducible project using the `worcs` R-package, which streamlines the creation of reproducible projects. WORCS is easy to learn for beginners while also being highly extendable and compliant with most institutional and journal requirements. Next, topics essential for computational social science are addressed: random seeds, parallelization, integration testing to catch errors before running time-consuming analyses, and combining worcs with “targets” to reduce redundant computation, saving time and reducing the computational studies’ climate footprint. Participants are encouraged to bring their own code – e.g., for a simulation study, or to use sample code provided by the organizer. Q&A and Discussion sections ensure that the tutorial’s content aligns with participants’ needs, while guided demonstrations and hands-on exercises allow participants to develop the experience and skills needed to implement open reproducible workflows in their future research. Participants should bring a laptop and complete this setup tutorial before joining the workshop:",Caspar van Lissa,Vingen 7,,,,
2025-07-21 09:00:00,2025-07-21 12:30:00,single,Tutorial 7: Scalable analysis of GPs human mobility data with applications to socio-spatial inequality,"Large-scale human mobility datasets derived from mobile phones have become a valuable resource in the field of human mobility. They have found diverse applications in tasks such as travel demand estimation, urban planning, epidemic modelling, and more. However, these datasets remain largely inaccessible to the broader community due, in part, to the technical difficulties in processing these massive datasets and the comprehensive understanding of data bias and potential. In this tutorial, we will first introduce an open-source library of code from the NOMAD project (Network for Open Mobility Analysis and Datasets) as a tool to overcome the technical challenges of processing massive data sets. In the second part, we will demonstrate a critical application of human mobility analysis - socio-spatial inequality developed in realTRIPS projects (EvALuating Land Use and TRansport Impacts on Urban Mobility Patterns). The analysis provides an understanding of differences in how social phenomena play out across neighbourhoods, regions, and sociodemographic groups. Overall, we aim to demonstrate reproducible and widely applicable research methods. The library used for part of the analysis, built on Python and Spark, is designed to process this class of data at scale and implements a broad range of processing algorithms which will be employed for this particular application","Jorge Barreras, Thomas Li, Chen Zhong, Cate Heine, Adam (Zhengzi) Zhou",Vingen 8,,,,
2025-07-21 09:00:00,2025-07-21 12:30:00,single,Tutorial 9: Reinforcement Learning and Evolutionary Game Theory are Two Sides of the Same Coin,"Assuming that individuals are rational is often unjustified in many social and biological systems, even for simple pairwise interactions. As such, in many real-world multi-agent systems, the goal is shifted towards the understanding of the complex ecologies of behaviours emerging from a given dilemma (or ”game”). This is where evolutionary game theory (EGT) shines as a theoretical and computational framework. Likewise, from the computational perspective, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) models how self-interested agents learn and improve their policies through the accumulation of rewards coming from their past experience. Just like strategies in evolutionary game theory adapting to one another, agents’ actions evolve based on their empirical returns. The similarity is no coincidence. In this tutorial we show how these two frameworks, although applied in different context, are two sides of the same coin, presenting fundamen-tal mathematical results that demonstrate how the equilibria of population dynamics can be encoded by simple RL agents policies and the other way round. We will provide use-cases in which each modelling framework is useful. This tutorial will help the social science practitioner acquire new tools coming from AI and complex systems, and computer science practitioners to understand their research in terms of economic models.","Paolo Turrini, Elias Fernández Domingos",Vingen 6,,,,

2025-07-21 13:30:00,2025-07-21 17:00:00,single,Tutorial 2: Bridging Human and LLM Annotations for Statistically Valid Computational Social Science,"The tutorial provides participants with a practical, hands-on experience in integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and human annotations to streamline annotation workflows, ensuring both efficiency and statistical rigor. As LLMs revolutionize data annotation with their ability to label and analyze complex social phenomena at unprecedented scales, they also pose challenges in ensuring the reliability and validity of results. This tutorial introduces a systematic approach to combining LLM annotations with human input, enabling researchers to optimize annotation processes while maintaining rigorous standards for statistical inference. The session begins by framing the opportunities and challenges of leveraging LLMs for Computational Social Science (CSS). The tutorial demonstrates techniques for combining LLM annotations with human annotations to ensure statistically valid results while minimizing annotation costs. Through hands-on implementation using open-source datasets and code notebooks, participants will apply these methods to popular CSS tasks, such as stance detection, media bias, and online hate and misinformation. Additionally, the session will explore how these approaches can be adapted to other domains, such as psychology, sociology, and political science. By the end of the session, participants will gain actionable skills for reliably leveraging LLMs for data annotation in their own research.","Kristina Gligoric, Cinoo Lee, Tijana Zrnic",Hemeryck,,,,
2025-07-21 13:30:00,2025-07-21 17:00:00,single,Tutorial 4: Planetary Causal Inference: an R tutorial on how to conduct causal inference with satellite images data,"This R tutorial is based on our book-in-progress, Planetary Causal Inference (PCI), which proposes using Earth observation (EO) data to enhance social science research by expanding both the scope and resolution of data analysis. Traditional data sources like surveys and national statistics are often expensive, limited in coverage, and rarely provide real-time insights—challenges that hinder comprehensive planetary-scale studies. In contrast, satellite-based EO data offer fine-grained, global perspectives on phenomena such as urban growth, poverty, deforestation, and conflict, capturing information across diverse spatial and temporal scales. This tutorial introduces the emerging practice of EO-based machine learning (EO-ML), where advanced models transform satellite-derived spatial data into proxies for social science metrics and feed these into causal inference pipelines. By integrating knowledge from geography, history, and multi-level frameworks, PCI fosters a broader understanding of human–environment interactions, helping researchers address questions that span household, neighborhood, regional, and global contexts. Through its cookbook-style presentation of “ingredients” (data, methods) and “recipes” (analysis steps), PCI equips social scientists to confidently adopt and adapt EO-ML tools. This approach helps generate highly detailed insights and enables researchers to explore pressing global issues—ranging from armed conflict to sustainable development—with new analytical power and precision.

2025-07-21 13:30:00,2025-07-21 17:00:00,single,Tutorial 6: Research Cartography with Atlas,"Scientific inquiry depends on ""standing on the shoulders of giants"" — building on the findings of prior work. However integrating knowledge across many papers is challenging and unreliable. Papers may use terms differently, or leverage different terms to describe the same thing. Further, papers may over emphasis an outcome, or may not describe research activity with enough detail to fully understand what was measured. All these challenges, and many more make understanding the complete landscape of a research area almost impossible. Atlas, an open source platform, tackles this problem by emphasizing commensurability—the practice of describing research findings in ways that enable valid comparisons. Instead of relying solely on persuasive narratives, Atlas systematically codes experimental attributes, from detailed methodology to condition-specific distinctions. This process shifts the focus to what researchers actually do, rather than merely what they claim, making the integration of diverse studies more reliable. We will demonstrate how Atlas transforms research papers into a series of quantified dimensions, producing what we refer to as research cartography. Through guided exercises, you will learn to apply Atlas to your own projects, analyzing multiple levels of data within a single study. Our goal is to show how this method enhances transparency and reliability in scientific conclusions, ultimately advancing progress by enabling evidence-based insights that are both rigorous and comparable.","Mark Whiting, Linnea Gandhi, Amirhossein Nakhaei, Duncan Watts",Vingen 6,,,,
2025-07-21 13:30:00,2025-07-21 17:00:00,single,Tutorial 8: Mobility Flows and Accessibility Using R and Big Open Data,"Large-scale human mobility datasets provide unprecedented opportunities to analyze movement patterns, generating critical insights for many fields of research. Until recently, access to human mobility data was a privilege of a few researchers. Thanks to countries like Spain that pioneered to make high resolution aggregated human mobility data open, such data is becoming increasingly accessible, and similar mobility data may soon be widely available as part of official statistics across the European Union. However, the complexity and sheer volume of this data present practical challenges related to data acquisition, efficient processing, geographic disaggregation, network representation, and interactive visualization. The workshop addresses these challenges by showcasing end-to-end workflows that harness state-of-the-art R packages and methods. Participants will learn how to acquire and manage multi-gigabyte mobility datasets on consumer level laptops, combine and compare the actual mobility flows and the access to opportunities, and create informative mobility flows visualizations. Spanish open mobility data is used as a case study. This data contains anonymized and grouped flows between more than 3500 locations in Spain with hourly intervals across 3 full years. Thanks to the inclusion of several demographic variables, this data presents a universe of opportunities for analysis and research questions to explore.","Egor Kotov, Johannes Mast",Vingen 7,,,,

Computational social-cognitive models can be used to deduce the efficacy of potential training or educational interventions to promote sustainable practices. Tutorial attendees will learn to use the socmod library to create their own models of social learning and social influence to predict the relative success of different intervention strategies.

This often requires much larger or otherwise much more informative studies. It also requires choices of how to quantify effects. What relationship do various such quantifications have to scientific knowledge and, of particular relevance in applied work, to decisions? Using some examples from our recent experiments and other prominent, recent studies, I highlight how some effect size measures are typically decision-irrelevant and do not facilitate gaining generalizable knowledge. I also examine how we can use relevance to decisions to help select quantities of interest in the context of interventions in networks.",Dean Eckles,De Geerhallen,,,,

In other words, rarely do people use social network or network science techniques in isolation; rather, these are augmented with other computationally based techniques such as computational linguistics and machine learning.  In the area of social-cybersecurity, a field concerned with identifying, characterizing and mitigating online harms such as undue influence, disinformation, hate-speech and extremism, network science is frequently combined with various AI techniques to build more effective tools to support interventions, to improve imperial analysis, and to simulate behavior. A particular area of concern is influence, that is ""who is influencing whom on line, how and to what effect?"".  The BEND framework has been proposed as a way of systematically characterising such information operations, and it has been operationalized using network science + AI techniques in a way that enables the analyst in detecting, characterizing, mitigating, and assessing the impact of influence activities, those being influenced, and the influencer.  In this presentation the BEND framework and its operationalization using network science+AI  will be described.  Then the insights that can be drawn using this approach will be illustrated using data from various events around the world.

However, they will be of most use to political and social science researchers when they are used in a way that advances understanding about real human behaviors and concerns. To promote the scientific use of LLMs, we suggest that researchers in the political and social sciences need to remain focused on the scientific goal of inference. To this end, we discuss the challenges and opportunities related to scientific inference with LLMs, using validation of model output as an illustrative case for discussion. We propose a set of guidelines related to establishing the failure and success of LLMs when completing particular tasks, and discuss how we can make inferences from these observations. We conclude with a discussion of how this refocus will improve the accumulation of shared scientific knowledge about these tools and their uses in the social sciences.",Lisa P.

2025-07-23 09:00:00,2025-07-23 09:45:00,keynote,Keynote 5: Why Qualitative Research Needs Computational Social Science,"Computational methods are playing a larger role in qualitative social science, but often with the goal of scaling or automating qualitative inquiry. Scaling and automating approaches are rooted in quantitative traditions, which are focused on measurement, generalizability, and evaluation against fixed benchmarks. But qualitative research is grounded in a different logic. It aims to understand meaning, context, and how people experience the world differently depending on their social position. This talk argues that if we want to use computational methods for qualitative research, we need to develop them differently than the current approach. For example, while machine learning is often framed as a tool for classification, its strength in identifying emergent patterns in large amounts of qualitative data aligns with inductive and abductive reasoning long used in qualitative research. Evaluating classification algorithms against a pre-determined ""ground truth"" stunts their development for inductive/abductive exploration and qualitative logics. In this talk I will share examples of how computational tools can support qualitative goals—not by making qualitative work more quantitative, but by shifting how we build, evaluate, and use these tools. This includes recognizing multiple perspectives in the data, treating researchers as active interpreters, and developing criteria that reflect qualitative rather than quantitative values.",Laura Nelson,De Geerhallen,,,,

People occupying different cultural positions often interpret the same realities in different ways. Recent advances in computational linguistics now make it possible to systematically measure these divergent interpretations at scale. In this talk, I introduce the Categorization-Association model of interpretation—a framework for capturing shared interpretation as well as processes of interpretive coordination and divergence. Drawing on computational analyses across multiple cultural domains—from American politics to popular understandings of leisure, work, and artificial intelligence—I show how culture reveals a fractured or ""broken"" geometry of meaning. This work illustrates how computational methods can help deepen our sociological understanding of culture, while underscoring the importance of grounding computational social science in robust theory.",Amir Goldberg,De Geerhallen,,,,

We ask whether when people get lucky the trajectory of their life success increasingly diverges from that of their unlucky counterpart. We study this question theoretically using basic models of positive feedback. Empirically we look at the lives of thousands of Americans tracked in panel survey data and millions of Swedes captured in register data. We focus on income as measure of success and study a host of different ways by which people might be lucky or unlucky at different stages of the life course. We use causal identification strategies to isolate pairs of egos and alteregos who led similarly lives before the event and then compare their life courses afterwards.,Arnout van de Rijt,De Geerhallen,,,,

We demonstrate how a prevalent feature of AI agents––being excessively prosocial––reshapes trust dynamics in experiments (N = 675) simulating hybrid societies comprising humans and AI agents (“bots”) powered by state-of-the-art large language models. Using a partner-selection game with pre-decision communication, Study 1 revealed a paradox: Undisclosed bots, despite being more trustworthy than humans and detectable by communication, were not preferentially selected. Instead, bots’ prosociality was misattributed to their human competitors. Study 2 showed that disclosing the human or bot identity of partner candidates initially enhanced humans’ bias against bots, but improved trust calibration over time. Our findings highlight the importance of evaluating AI agents in interactive hybrid environments and the role of transparency in facilitating dynamic calibration of trust in human-AI ecosystems.","Yaomin Jiang, Levin Brinkmann, Anne-Marie Nussberger, Ivan Soraperra, JF Bonnefon, Iyad Rahwan",De Geerhallen,"Lightning Talks I: Human-LLM Interactions, Mobility & Inequality",1,,361

For instance, complex opinion dynamics may be simulated by initializing LLM agents with different opinions on a topic and observing their opinion change throughout a discussion. However, past attempts to use LLM agents for such simulations revealed an inherent bias toward consensus and toward factual accuracy, driving agents' opinions to the consensus opinion encoded in the LLMs. Moreover, the robustness of such simulations remains uncertain due to prompt sensitivity, while the lack of standardized evaluation metrics and benchmarks further reduces the comparability across studies. In this work, we used Bayesian modeling to disentangle agent-inherent biases from interaction dynamics. Our model reveals that discussions between two LLM agents are dominated by two biases; (i) toward the LLM's prior opinion distribution for a specific topic (topic bias) and (ii) toward agreement irrespective of the prompted statement (agreement bias), whereas the initial prompting of the agent's opinion has little impact. By fitting an effective Bayesian model of opinion dynamics to the opinion shifts in LLMs, we provide a human-interpretable method that potentially simplifies the modeling of large groups of artificial agents.","Vincent Christoph Brockers, David Alexander Ehrlich, Viola Priesemann",De Geerhallen,"Lightning Talks I: Human-LLM Interactions, Mobility & Inequality",2,,373

Here, we investigate the role of algorithms, human users, and platform guidelines in suppressing disclosures of racial discrimination. In a field study of actual posts from a neighborhood-based social media platform, we find that when users talk about their experiences as targets of racism, their posts are disproportionately flagged for removal as toxic by five widely used moderation algorithms from major online platforms, including the most recent large language models. We show that human users disproportionately flag these disclosures for removal as well. Next, in a follow-up experiment, we demonstrate that merely witnessing such suppression negatively influences how Black Americans view the community and their place in it. Finally, using computational linguistic tools, we identify key factors influencing flagging behavior and develop an intervention that successfully reduces misguided flagging behavior across the political spectrum.","Cinoo Lee, Kristina Gligoric, Pratyusha Kalluri, Maggie Harrington, Esin DURMUS, Kiara L.

We introduce DiverCity, a measure that quantifies the extent to which traffic can potentially be distributed across multiple, loosely overlapping routes. Analyzing 56 global cities, we find that DiverCity is tied to traffic efficiency and network characteristics such as network length and number of intersections. Within cities, DiverCity increases with distance from the city center before stabilizing in the periphery but declines in the proximity of mobility attractors. We demonstrate that strategic speed limit adjustments on mobility attractors can increase DiverCity while preserving travel efficiency. In addition, we use a controlled setting to isolate the interplay between mobility attractors and DiverCity, confirming the patterns observed in real-world cities. DiverCity provides a practical tool for urban planners and policymakers to optimize road network design and balance route diversification, efficiency, and sustainability.","Giuliano Cornacchia, Luca Pappalardo, Mirco Nanni, Dino Pedreschi, Marta C.

We first document substantial variation in the rate at which individuals form cross-class social ties, with large differences in friending rates both within and across countries. Cross-class social ties are relatively common in parts of Western Europe and relatively scarce in South Africa and parts of South Asia. Countries vary in the degree to which cross-class ties are determined by regional differences in average income. In places such as Italy, one's degree of connection to high income peers is largely determined by one's place of residence, while other countries such as Saudi Arabia, high- and low-socioeconomic status (SES) users have dramatically different networks, even within a region. We link our measures of cross-class social ties with external measures of intergenerational mobility, finding that places where low-SES individuals have more high-SES friends have higher rates of economic mobility in all countries in which we have data.","Drew Johnston, Michael Bailey, Ayush Kumar, Theresa Kuchler, Johannes Stroebel",De Geerhallen,"Lightning Talks I: Human-LLM Interactions, Mobility & Inequality",5,,432

This paper also demonstrates how demographic characteristics predict trajectory typology memberships and how typology memberships are associated with later-life outcomes. Using data from the 1970 British Cohort Study, I first establish a two-dimensional life trajectory data combining individuals’ partnership histories and work/education histories. I apply transformer-based embeddings to capture complex temporal dependencies and dynamics from multi-dimensional trajectory data. I then apply K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) clustering methods to classify individuals based on learned representations. The choice of embedding models, clustering methods, and hyperparameters is optimized via key performance metrics. Preliminary results identify four female clusters and five male clusters with distinct work-life trajectories. Qualitatively, the four female clusters can be described as “late bloomers”, “independent & steady”, “marriage & caregiving first”, and “career-family jugglers”. The five male clusters can be described as “early cohabitation with continuous struggles”, “cohabiting careerists”, “late committers, long learners”, “traditional breadwinners”, and “young settlers”. Among them, the “independent & steady” and “marriage & caregiving first” women are associated with worse economic security and physical and mental health outcomes at the age of 46. “Early cohabitation with continuous struggles” men are associated with worse economic security and physical and mental health outcomes at the age of 46. Another key finding is that GMM performs better for women while K-Means performs better for men in clustering life trajectories. It might suggest fundamental gendered differences in life-course patterns—with women having more fluid, overlapping, and nonlinear trajectories than men. This research makes both a methodological contribution as one of the first studies to apply transformer-based embeddings to life trajectory data, and a substantive contribution by advancing the understanding of the gendered typologies of behavioral patterns and life trajectories.",Zerui Tian,De Geerhallen,"Lightning Talks I: Human-LLM Interactions, Mobility & Inequality",6,,116

Choices in personal references, such as first or last names, may indicate not just the relationship between individuals but also the underlying (gender) biases, personal relationships, status differences, or attitudes toward the referenced individual. In professional settings, naming conventions often reinforce power hierarchies, with last name usage indicating perceived eminence or authority. This seemingly subtle linguistic choice can have significant real-world implications, influencing perceptions of credibility and even the likelihood of receiving career awards. Gender plays a crucial role in these patterns, with male professionals being more than twice as likely as their female counterparts to be referenced by last name. Prior studies on spoken political discourse, such as analyses of American radio transcripts, confirm that gendered naming conventions persist in verbal discussions of politicians. In a similar vein, a study of Reddit comments examining references to politicians found that male politicians are overwhelmingly referred to by last name (69.7% of the time), whereas female politicians are more frequently addressed by their full name (41.1%) or given name (25.1%). While this prior work establishes a strong correlation between gender and reference type, the causal mechanisms remain only partially understood. In this study, we demonstrate that gendered naming conventions are prevalent not only in (direct) personal interactions but also in professional discourse across different domains, as recorded through quotes in news articles. By controlling for the context in which quotes occur, we aim to isolate the drivers of reference choices and explore how linguistic patterns may shape public perceptions of authority and competence.","Justyna Janczy, Marko Čuljak, Andreas Spitz, Akhil Arora",De Geerhallen,"Lightning Talks I: Human-LLM Interactions, Mobility & Inequality",7,,854

However, measuring these subtle forms of media bias at scale remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a large, ongoing (from January 1, 2023 to present), near real-time dataset and computational framework developed to enable systematic study of selection and framing bias in news coverage. Our pipeline integrates large language models (LLMs) with scalable, near real-time news scraping to extract structured annotations--including political lean, tone, topics, article type, and events--across hundreds of articles per day. We quantify these dimensions of coverage at multiple levels, from the sentence-level to the article-level and to aggregate publisher trends, expanding the ways researchers can analyze media bias in the modern news landscape. In addition to a curated dataset, we also release an interactive web platform for convenient exploration of this data. Together, these contributions establish a reusable methodology for studying media bias at scale, providing empirical resources for future research. By leveraging the corpus’s breadth across time and publishers, we present examples (focused on the 150,000+ articles examined in 2024) that illustrate how this dataset can reveal patterns in news coverage and bias, supporting both academic research and real-world efforts to enhance media accountability.","Samar Haider, Jenny Shan Wang, Amir Tohidi Kalorazi, Timothy Dörr, David Rothschild, Chris Callison-Burch, Duncan J.

While researchers have long studied how media select and frame sets of events for their coverage, and computational approaches to media-bias detection have gained popularity in recent years, to date, no unified framework for the scalable detection of media bias exists. We propose to develop such a framework based on the notion of actor portrayals, i.e., language patterns arising from actor descriptions in media reporting. As we demonstrate for the Israel–Palestine and the Russia–Ukraine conflicts, measuring the differences between actor portrayals using Bayesian statistics allows us to quantify media bias without reference to some ""unbiased"" baseline. Our approach readily applies to any corpus of news articles or other media items collected from one or more news outlets, and it opens novel research directions in the computational study of media bias.","Ali Salloum, Yan Xia, Mikko Kivelä, Corinna Coupette",De Geerhallen,"Lightning Talks II: Media Bias, Oral Histories, Repressive Digital Governance, Science of Science",2,,209

We use textual representation and semantic embeddings of narratives to represent the interviews themselves. Our analysis demonstrates that shared origin is a powerful determinant of narrative similarity across thematic keywords, landmarks, and significant figures, as well as in semantic embeddings of the narratives. Meanwhile, shared residence fosters cohesion, with its impact significantly amplified when paired with shared origin. Additionally, women’s narratives exhibit heightened thematic cohesion, particularly in recounting experiences of the British occupation, underscoring the gendered dimensions of memory formation.

Although effective propaganda states can invest massive resources and efforts to disseminate state propaganda, the personalized curation and filter bubbles embedded in social media algorithms complicate efforts to reach users with nonpolitical interests. While research has focused on the content and dissemination strategies of authoritarian political propaganda, less is known about the role of platform algorithms in increasing or inhibiting the reach of political propaganda. Through the collection and analysis of a novel dataset of 120,245 trending and recommended videos on Bilibili, one of China’s largest entertainment platforms, we found that recommendation algorithms on the entertainment platform can amplify the visibility of state-produced content. Coupled with a different content mix featuring a significantly higher presence of propaganda content than non-state accounts, state-sponsored accounts leverage both new content strategies and algorithmic settings on the entertainment platform to increase the reach of their propaganda. These findings highlight an algorithmic pathway through which authoritarian regimes may increase their online influence, offering critical insights into the role of social media algorithms in an authoritarian context.","Yingdan Lu, Xinyi Liu, Carl Zhou",De Geerhallen,"Lightning Talks II: Media Bias, Oral Histories, Repressive Digital Governance, Science of Science",4,,377

We distinguishe between general claims and those documented via causal inference methods (e.g., DiD, IV, RDD, RCTs). We document a substantial rise in the share of causal claims—from roughly 4% in 1990 to nearly 28% in 2020—reflecting the growing influence of the ``credibility revolution.'' We find that causal narrative complexity (e.g., the depth of causal chains) strongly predicts both publication in top-5 journals and higher citation counts, whereas non-causal complexity tends to be uncorrelated or negatively associated with these outcomes. Novelty is also pivotal for top-5 publication, but only when grounded in credible causal methods: introducing genuinely new causal edges or paths markedly increases both the likelihood of acceptance at leading outlets and long-run citations, while non-causal novelty exhibits weak or even negative effects. Papers engaging with central, widely recognized concepts tend to attract more citations, highlighting a divergence between factors driving publication success and long-term academic impact. Finally, bridging underexplored concept pairs is rewarded primarily when grounded in causal methods, yet such gap filling exhibits no consistent link with future citations. Overall, our findings suggest that methodological rigor and causal innovation are key drivers of academic recognition, but sustained impact may require balancing novel contributions with conceptual integration into established economic discourse.",Prashant Garg,De Geerhallen,"Lightning Talks II: Media Bias, Oral Histories, Repressive Digital Governance, Science of Science",8,,70

Our study reveals that LLMs achieve this by learning a ""geometry of perspective"" that linearly represents subjective perspectives in the activation space, where similar simulated perspectives are represented closer to each other. Specifically, we probe the hidden layers of open, transformer-based LLMs (Llama-2-7b-chat, Mistral-7b-instruct, Vicuna-7b) when prompted to generate texts under the ideological perspective of distinct politicians. We find a set of attention heads that represent U.S. ideological slant, which is primarily located in the middle layers known to encode high-level concepts and tasks. The activation of these attention heads, when prompted about U.S. politicians and media outlets, linearly correlates with existing measures of their ideological slant. We use this activation to detect the ideological slant implicitly adopted by an LLM as it is generating each token. We further show that by intervening on these attention heads, we can tune LLM output to any position along the linear dimension from a liberal to conservative ideological perspective. Our research shows that political ideology serves as a fundamental dimension of LLM representations, and present an interpretability method to identify, monitor, and control the subjective perspective used to generate text.","Junsol Kim, James Evans, Aaron Schein",Concert hall,LLMs & Society,1,,946

This study explores their ability to model implicit multidimensional ideological structures as continuous manifolds. We propose two frameworks for extracting ideological manifolds from LLM neural activations: the corpus-based framework reduces the dimensionality of the activation space to automatically derive optimal manifolds from labeled text corpora; and the reference-based framework constructs interpretable spaces using fewer labeled texts as reference for projecting arbitrary text representations. These frameworks enable quantitative analysis of ideological positioning in text, presenting novel methodologies for social science research. Our analyses reveal that the emergent manifold structures not only align well with established political science evaluations, but also demonstrate remarkable consistencies across different layers, different models, and both proposed frameworks. This suggests that modern LLMs can indeed internalize nuanced ideological spectra in an accurate and robust way that mirrors the real-world social-political dimensions.","Yilun Liu, Daniel Matter, Jürgen Pfeffer",Concert hall,LLMs & Society,3,,254

ASR systems' growing use warrants robust and standardized auditing approaches to ensure automated transcriptions of high and equitable quality. This is especially critical for people with speech and language disorders (such as aphasia) who may disproportionately depend on ASR systems to navigate everyday life. In this work, we identify three pitfalls in existing standard ASR auditing procedures, and demonstrate how addressing them impacts audit results via a case study of six popular ASR systems' performance for aphasia speakers. First, audits often adhere to a single method of text standardization during data pre-processing, which (a) masks variability in ASR performance from applying different standardization methods, and (b) may not be consistent with how users---especially those from marginalized speech communities---would want their transcriptions to be standardized. Second, audits often display high-level demographic findings without further considering performance disparities among (a) more nuanced demographic subgroups, and (b) relevant covariates capturing acoustic information from the input audio. Third, audits often rely on a single gold-standard metric---the Word Error Rate---which does not fully capture the extent of errors arising from generative AI models, such as transcription hallucinations. We propose a more holistic auditing framework that accounts for these three pitfalls, and exemplify its results in our case study, finding consistently worse ASR performance for aphasia speakers relative to a control group. We call on practitioners to implement these robust ASR auditing practices that remain flexible to the rapidly changing ASR landscape.","Katelyn X.

We present a series of five studies that together provide evidence consistent with the argument that LLMs are already being influenced by state propaganda in the context of Chinese state media. First, we demonstrate that material originating from China's Publicity Department appears in large quantities in Chinese language open-source training datasets. Second, we connect this to commercial LLMs by showing not only that they have memorized sequences that are distinctive of propaganda, but propaganda phrases are memorized at much higher rates than those in other documents. Third, we conduct additional training on an LLM with openly available weights to show that training on Chinese state propaganda generates more positive answers to prompts about Chinese political institutions and leaders---evidence that propaganda itself, not mere differences in culture and language, can be a causal factor behind this phenomenon. Fourth, we document an implication in commercial models---that querying in Chinese generates more positive responses about China's institutions and leaders than the same queries in English. Fifth, we show that this language difference holds in prompts related to Chinese politics created by actual Chinese-speaking users of LLMs. Our results suggest the troubling conclusion that going forward there may be strategic incentives for states and other actors to increase the prevalence of propaganda in the future as generative AI becomes more ubiquitous.","Hannah Waight, Eddie Yang, Yin Yuan, Solomon Messing, Margaret Roberts, Brandon M.

This understanding is critical, as disparities in the quality of LLM responses can perpetuate representational harms by ignoring the different cultural contexts underlying Simplified versus Traditional Chinese, and can exacerbate downstream harms in LLM-facilitated decision-making in domains such as education or hiring. To investigate potential LLM performance disparities, we design two benchmark tasks that reflect real-world scenarios: regional term choice (prompting the LLM to name a described item which is referred to differently in Taiwan and Mainland China), and regional name choice (prompting the LLM to choose who to hire from a list of names in both Simplified and Traditional Chinese). For both tasks, we audit the performance of ten leading commercial LLM services and open-sourced models---spanning those primarily trained on English, Simplified Chinese, or Traditional Chinese. Our qualitative analyses indicate that biases in LLM responses are dependent on both the task and prompting language: while most LLMs disproportionately favored Simplified Chinese responses in the regional term choice task, they surprisingly favored Traditional Chinese names in the regional name choice task. We find that these disparities may arise from differences in training data representation, written character preferences, and tokenization of Simplified and Traditional Chinese. These findings highlight the need for further analysis of LLM biases; as such, we provide an open-sourced benchmark dataset to foster reproducible evaluations of future LLM behavior across Chinese language variants.","Hanjia Lyu, Jiebo Luo, Jian Kang, Allison Koenecke",Concert hall,LLMs & Bias,2,,81

Names have also been found to serve as powerful signals of gender, race, and status in the social hierarchy--a pecking order in which individual positions shape others’ expectations on their perceived competence and worth (Podolny, 2005). With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and given that names are often an input for LLMs, it is crucial to evaluate whether LLMs sort people into status positions based on first and last names and, if so, whether it is in an unfair, biased fashion. While prior work has primarily investigated biases in first names, little attention has been paid to last names and even less to the combined effects of first and last names. In this study, we conduct a large-scale analysis with bootstrap standard errors of 45,000 name variations across 5 ethnicities to examine how AI-generated responses exhibit systemic name biases. Our study investigates three key characteristics of inequality and finds that LLMs reflect, construct, and reinforce status hierarchies based on names that signal gender and ethnicity as they encode differential expectations of competence, economic, and leadership potential. Contrary to the common assumption that AI tends to favor Whites, we show that East and, in some contexts, South Asian names receive higher rankings. We also disaggregate Asians, a population projected to be the largest immigrant group in the U.S. by 2055. Our results challenge the monolithic Asian model minority assumption, illustrating a more complex and stratified model of bias. Gender moderates biases, with girls having advantages in certain racial groups while facing unfair disadvantages in others. Additionally, spanning cultural categories by adopting Western first names improves AI-perceived status for East and Southeast Asian students, particularly for girls. Our findings underscore the importance of intersectional and more nuanced understandings of race, gender, and mixed identities in the evaluation of LLMs, rather than relying on broad, monolithic, and mutually exclusive racial or gender categories. By examining LLM bias and discrimination in our multicultural contexts through the sociological status lenses, our study illustrates potential harms of using LLMs in education as they do not merely reflect implicit biases but also actively construct new social hierarchies that can unfairly shape long-term life trajectories. An LLM that systematically assigns subtly less favorable evaluations and expectations to students with certain name signals reinforces a tiered system of opportunity. Some groups may face structural disadvantages, while others encounter undue pressure from inflated expectations.","Jonathan Sakunkoo, Annabella Sakunkoo",Concert hall,LLMs & Bias,4,,900

The evaluation focuses on consistency, factuality, representation bias in gender, ethnicity, and academic popularity. Results show that llama models excel in author factuality, gemma2-9b performs best in epoch-based recommendations, and mixtral-8x7b leads in seniority matching. All LLMs exhibit biases, over-representing males and Whites while under-representing Asians. Compared to the physicist population, they display a slight over-representation for females, Hispanics, and Blacks. Additionally, LLMs struggle with contemporary and lesser-known scientists, favoring highly cited researchers and Nobel laureates.

Women scientists are significantly underrepresented, with lower recognition rates across all LLMs, amplifying existing gender disparities in science. Similarly, regional biases persist, favoring North American and Western European researchers over those from Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

Investigating LLM-Assisted Annotation for Subjective Tasks,"LLM use in annotation is becoming widespread, and given LLMs’ overall promising performance and speed, putting humans in the loop to simply “review"" LLM annotations can be tempting. In subjective tasks with multiple plausible answers, this can impact both evaluation of LLM performance, and analysis using these labels in a social science task downstream. In a pre-registered experiment with 350 unique annotators and 7,000 annotations across 4 conditions, 2 models, and 2 datasets, we find that presenting crowdworkers with LLM-generated annotation suggestions did not make them faster annotators, but did improve their self-reported confidence in the task. More importantly, annotators strongly took the LLM suggestions, significantly changing the label distribution compared to the baseline. We show that when these labels created with LLM assistance are used to evaluate LLM performance, reported model performance significantly increases. We show how changes in label distributions as a result of LLM assistance can affect conclusions drawn by analyzing even “human-approved"" LLM-annotated datasets.

In computational social science (CSS), researchers are increasingly leveraging LLM annotations to complement slow and expensive human annotations. Still, guidelines for collecting and using LLM annotations, without compromising the validity of downstream conclusions, remain limited. We introduce Confidence-Driven Inference: a method that combines LLM annotations and LLM confidence indicators to strategically select which human annotations should be collected, with the goal of producing accurate statistical estimates and provably valid confidence intervals while reducing the number of human annotations needed. Our approach comes with safeguards against LLM annotations of poor quality, guaranteeing that the conclusions will be both valid and no less accurate than if we only relied on human annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Confidence-Driven Inference over baselines in statistical estimation tasks across three CSS settings--text politeness, stance, and bias--reducing the needed number of human annotations by over 25% in each. Although we use CSS settings for demonstration, Confidence-Driven Inference can be used to estimate most standard quantities across a broad range of NLP problems.","Kristina Gligorić, Tijana Zrnic, Cinoo Lee, Emmanuel Candes, Dan Jurafsky",Hemeryck,"LLMs, Annotation, Synthetic Data",2,,815

Recent analyses revealed that scientific publications already exhibit evidence of AI-specific language. But this evidence is inconclusive, since scientists may simply be using AI to copy-edit their writing. To explore whether AI has influenced human spoken communication, we applied econometric causal inference techniques to 740,249 hours of human discourse from 360,445 YouTube academic talks and 771,591 conversational podcast episodes across multiple disciplines. We detected a measurable and abrupt increase in the use of words preferentially generated by ChatGPT—such as delve, comprehend, boast, swift, and meticulous—after its release. These findings provide the first empirical evidence that humans increasingly imitate LLMs in their spoken language. Our results raise societal and policy-relevant concerns about the potential of AI to unintentionally reduce linguistic diversity, or to be deliberately misused for mass manipulation.

While studies document an overall decline in UGC following GenAI adoption, understanding the heterogeneous effects across different user groups remains crucial for predicting the future of human-AI knowledge sharing. This study examines the impact of GenAI, specifically ChatGPT-3.5 release, on user interactions across Stack Exchange platforms, with a focus on Stack Overflow. Using a natural experiment approach, we analyze changes in activity patterns and interaction dynamics across user expertise levels, measured through platform reputation scores. Our findings reveal a striking pattern: while GenAI adoption has substantially reduced participation from low-reputation users, likely decreasing repetitive and basic questions, high-reputation users show no significant decrease in their overall activity. Instead, these experienced users have shifted toward increased peer-to-peer interactions, suggesting a transformation in how expert knowledge is shared and maintained. The results indicate that GenAI serves as a replacement for basic interactions among low-reputation users while potentially enhancing collaboration among high-reputation users, fostering a complementary relationship between AI and human expertise. This dual role suggests a possible pathway for sustaining high-quality UGC essential for training future AI models, even as overall platform activity declines.","Babak Heydari, Negin Maddah",Vingen 1+2,Human-AI Interactions,3,,889

Does it make everyone an artist, enable the automation of creativity, or serve as a powerful tool for experts? While generative AI can enhance laypeople’s creativity, the role of artistic expertise in its use remains unclear. If professionals’ existing skills transfer to using this new technology, we should expect them to outperform laypeople even under the constraints of writing prompts for AI. In this pre-registered study, we test this hypothesis experimentally by comparing 50 active professional artists and a demographically matched sample of laypeople. We designed two tasks to approximate artistic practice for testing their capabilities in both faithful and creative image creation: writing prompts to replicate a reference image, or to move as far away as possible from it. Artists produced more faithful and creative outputs than their lay counterparts, as evaluated by computing the average similarity between reference images and participants’ creations. This suggests that expertise in visual art does provide an advantage in using generative AI for image generation, and that the skillset of artists is likely to remain relevant for using these tools. In an additional explorative comparison, GPT-4o matched average artists in copying accuracy and outperformed them in creativity. However, the top-performing artists exceeded both lay participants and GPT-4o. High variance among artists suggests differing abilities to leverage generative AI effectively. These outcomes highlight the importance of integrating artistic skills with AI training to prepare artists and other professionals for a technologically evolving landscape. We see a potential in collaborative synergy with generative AI, which could reshape creative industries and education in the arts.","Thomas F.

Drawing from developmental psychology and ego development theory, this study examines whether LLMs undergo constructive-developmental sequences akin to human ego development. Using segmented regression analysis on responses from 33 diverse LLMs with temperature settings, we assess developmental progression across varying parameter scales. Results reveal a significant positive correlation between model complexity and ego development stage scores (r = .39, p < .001). Segmented regression identified two key breakpoints: at ~3.82B parameters, models exhibited a sharp increase in developmental maturity (ΔSlope = 0.6208, p < .001), followed by a plateau beyond ~28.91B parameters (Slope = 0.03). The two-breakpoint model demonstrated superior fit (AIC = 1670.575, BIC = 1705.230, Adj. R² = 0.1847) compared to simpler models, with Davies' test confirming two significant transitions (p < .001). These findings suggest that LLMs exhibit developmental patterns analogous to human ego development stages, but with distinct limitations. The observed plateau raises critical questions about the limits of AI developmental complexity and its implications for AI alignment, deployment strategies, and responsible AI integration into human-centered applications.","Arti Thakur, Tom Murray, Martin Hilbert",Vingen 1+2,Human-AI Interactions,5,,235

However, this oversimplifies reality. Beyond this, a 2-LEVEL perspective emerges, where subgroups form not just by agreement but through shared animosities, shaping distinct structures of negativity. These hidden layers play a crucial role in polarization dynamics. To model polarization in signed networks, archetypal analysis has been used to identify extreme archetypes, while Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based autoencoders capture latent graph structures. However, explainable neural generative models for signed networks remain underexplored. We address this with the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE), which extracts node representations by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope governing polarization. Combining the Skellam distribution, relational archetypal analysis, and GNNs, SGAAE uncovers latent structures and competing communities. We introduce the 2-LEVEL network polarization problem and demonstrate how SGAAE characterizes it.

A single, satellite-derived “wealth map” can be remarkably cost-effective: once trained on a reference dataset (e.g., Demographic and Health Surveys), the map can substitute household-level outcomes in multiple new trials without requiring fresh surveys. However, two critical challenges complicate causal inference when reusing these ML outputs across varied interventions. First, \emph{model bias} arises because standard ML training often compresses the variance of the outcome. Empirically, predicted values overstate the poorest households and understate the wealthiest. Such \emph{variance compression} skews impact estimates whenever interventions move the outcome distribution. For example, an electrification project boosting lower-income households might appear to have a smaller effect if those households’ predicted values are already inflated. We address this by \emph{calibrating} each prediction: using a small hold-out sample, we regress predicted wealth on actual wealth, then rescale and shift the predictions to restore the missing variation. Second, substituting predicted outcomes for real data adds \emph{model uncertainty}. Even well-tuned maps can err more for some regions than others. Conventional approaches rarely incorporate these errors in final confidence intervals. To fix this, we exploit \emph{conformal prediction}, which yields interval estimates for each unit that reflect the model’s variability. These per-unit intervals can then be integrated with standard bootstrap routines to combine model-driven error and sampling error. Concretely, we propose a nested resampling procedure: (1) resample trial units to capture sampling-based fluctuations; (2) sample from each unit’s conformal distribution to capture prediction error. The result is a matrix of treatment-effect estimates reflecting both uncertainty sources. Our pipeline thus handles three steps for “one map, many trials.” First, calibrate out systematic bias so that average effects are not consistently deflated or inflated. Second, quantify per-unit error via conformal intervals to avoid overstating confidence. Third, unify these uncertainties with the trial’s usual sampling variance in a nested resampling approach. In simulations, ignoring either bias or model error can produce misleading effect sizes and artificially narrow confidence intervals. Correcting bias alone helps only partially: ignoring model variance still yields overconfidence. Meanwhile, ignoring bias but using conformal intervals only captures the dispersion around a systematically shifted center. With global-scale initiatives turning to satellite-based measurements to evaluate an ever-rising number of interventions, it is essential to address both the systematic distortions of ML predictions and their inherent uncertainty. By implementing calibration, conformal intervals, and joint error modeling, we pave the way for reliable, cost-effective causal inferences—even where in-person data collection is prohibitively expensive. This framework ultimately aims to preserve the benefits of large-scale EO-based poverty maps while improving scientific rigor for real-world policy decisions.","Markus Bo Pettersson, Connor Thomas Jerzak, Adel Daoud",Vingen 6,Social Prediction,3,,808

Despite growing evidence that predicted and observed behavior are often not $\textit{interchangeable}$, there is limited guidance on using LLMs to obtain valid estimates of causal effects and other parameters. We argue that LLM predictions should be treated as potentially informative observations, while human subjects serve as a gold standard in a $\textit{mixed subjects design}$. This paradigm preserves validity and offers more precise estimates at a lower cost than experiments relying exclusively on human subjects. We demonstrate---and extend---prediction-powered inference (PPI), a method that combines predictions and observations. We define the $\textit{PPI correlation}$ as a measure of interchangeability and derive the $\textit{effective sample size}$ for PPI. We also introduce a power analysis to optimally choose between $\textit{informative but costly}$ human subjects and $\textit{less informative but cheap}$ predictions of human behavior.

The PreFer data challenge (Predicting Fertility in the Netherlands) aimed to assess the predictability of having a(nother) child within three years based on either survey data from the LISS panel or full-population administrative data. Most models submitted in the data challenge outperformed the simple demographic baseline, and some exceeded individuals' own predictions of their fertility outcomes, with survey-based models surprisingly performing better than register-based models. However, even the best models fell below the theoretical upper limit of predictability caused by randomness inherent in conception and fetal survival.

The effect was particularly pronounced for occupations such as professionals, scientists, and technicians. However, we observed no significant effects in occupations less likely to offer WFH options.

Using two datasets of user-generated text (Debate.org and Reddit) that contain political and general topics, we find that GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B can reliably infer political affiliation even with only the posts in general domains. Moreover, the prediction can be improved even more by aggregating multiple text-level inferences---especially when weighted by the models' confidence scores. We also show that topics with closer semantic proximity to ""Politics"", as well as those with overlapping user participation yield higher predictive performance. Finally, we demonstrate that inferring political affiliation from general discourse allows accurate prediction of users' stances on unseen political issues, pointing to the real-world implications of LLM-driven profiling.

We introduce a child objectification language framework to classify comments into appearance-related and objectification-related categories, distinguishing between neutral descriptions and more problematic forms of discourse. This is a particularly difficult task due to the implicit and nuanced language of objectifying language. Our dataset comprises 432,178 comments across 8,367 videos featuring children from 500 unique accounts.

In this paper, we introduce a social science framework for analyzing images with generative multimodal models (MMs), which consists of three core tasks: curation, discovery, and measurement and inference. We demonstrate this framework with an empirical application that uses OpenAI’s GPT-4o model to analyze satellite and streetscape images (n = 1,101) to identify built environment features that contribute to contemporary residential segregation in U.S. cities. We find that model-generated labels are more reliable than research assistant-generated labels and comparably valid to expert-generated labels. We conclude with thoughts for other use cases and discuss how social scientists can work collaboratively to ensure that image analysis with generative MMs is rigorous, reproducible, ethical, and sustainable.","Tina Law, Elizabeth Roberto",Troselli,Image as Data,2,,206

The approach allows both analysis of relationships between visual content and covariates and representation of images as mixtures of multiple topics. The model adapts mixed-membership models to continuous image data through a hierarchical structure that links image embeddings, topic proportions, and covariates. Demonstrated on climate communication around UN Climate Conferences, the model effectively captures nuanced image representations, coherent topics and their interplay with the specific event, actor types (e.g. political or advocacy) and their stance (for/against).","Matias Piqueras, Alexandra Segerberg, Matteo Magnani",Troselli,Image as Data,3,,928

Insights about this phenomenon can serve to address the impact portrayals may have on migrants and the broader society. Two central elements of stereotyping in visual content are demographics and emotions. The demographics of people, such as age, gender, or facial features, might be over or under-represented in visual portrayals to emphasize certain narratives. In turn, emotions in images can attach specific emotional valence to migration-related discourses and thus shape attitudes. These aspects can vary based on the characteristics of the social context in which the imagery is created or used. Contextual factors influencing the representation of migration-related issues include the proportion of migrants in the population and societal attitudes toward migration. However, other important factors, such as social equality and perceived access to resources or opportunities, can also influence discourses surrounding migration and the perception of immigrants. This work analyzes visual data from various locations to reveal key characteristics of migration-related communication and its relation to context. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach that utilized computer vision techniques, the results were analyzed through the lenses of migration and gender studies, along with an intersectional perspective. The study consisted of two stages examining the following aspects: 1. The demographic and emotional information on people's faces in online images associated with migrants in ten countries with varying levels of migration acceptance and population (~ 18,000 images and 21,000 faces). 2. The relationships between socioeconomic variables and emotions in immigration-related visual media in 45 countries with varying levels of perception of corruption, economic inequality, and migration acceptance (~6,500 images and 10,500 faces). Results: 1. The initial phase of the analysis centered on examining the gender, age, facial features, and emotions (facial expressions) of individuals depicted in migration-related images sourced from a search engine. Three key migration-related search terms were explored: ”migrants,” ”refugees,” and ”expats,” along with their corresponding male and female forms (e.g., ”migrant man” and ”migrant woman”). The term ”refugees” was included because it is often mistakenly equated with ”migrants,” while ”expats” was examined as it refers to a group frequently perceived as the “good and highly wanted migrants”. The results indicate a misalignment between the demographics portrayed and official statistics. The gender distributions for the term migrants align more closely with that of asylum seekers than with the overall migrant population. Additionally, the findings reveal the power struggle within the “expat vs. migrant” dichotomy, which carries significant colonial connotations. The term “expat” is mainly associated with “white people,” while Asians are underrepresented when compared to the statistics on highly-skilled migration. Conversely, depictions of migrants and refugees —typically referring to asylum seekers— tend to reflect the demographics of low-skilled migrants. When it comes to emotions, these are predominantly negative and align with existing literature on emotional and gender stereotypes. Notably, the portrayals of refugees primarily emphasize emotions stereotypically associated with themes of poverty and risks for host societies. Moreover, positive emotions are more frequently associated with women than men and expats rather than refugees or migrants. It's important to note that these effects differ per location. 2. In the second phase, the analysis explored how socioeconomic factors such as perceived corruption, GDP per capita, and income inequality predict the average emotional content conveyed in images across various online media outlets in 45 countries. This analysis specifically focused on images associated with immigrants. This second analysis revealed that socioeconomic indexes—particularly corruption scores and GDP per capita—significantly predict the emotional content of media images related to immigrants. Specifically, higher levels of perceived corruption and lower GDP per capita correlate with increased negative emotions depicted in visual content. Additionally, a mediation analysis indicated that these factors mediate the relationship between income inequality and the emotional information conveyed in images. These findings are consistent with theories suggesting that heightened perceptions of competition for resources stemming from inequality or scarcity can lead to immigrants being viewed as threatening out-groups.","Juan Sebastian Olier, Camilla Spadavecchia",Troselli,Image as Data,5,,163
2025-07-22 14:30:00,2025-07-22 16:00:00,session_presentation,Evaluating Multimodal Language Models for Annotating Team Behaviors in Videos,"Multimodal language models capable of annotating interactions in videos present transformative opportunities for computational social science (CSS) and team research, enabling longitudinal and large-scale studies of how team behaviors drive innovation—a task previously hindered by labor-intensive manual coding [2]. While prior work has evaluated AI’s annotation of text or synthetic data [1], its reliability on real-world, multimodal data like video remains underexplored. We address this gap by testing whether Gemini, a state-of-the-art multimodal model, can reliably annotate 23 team behaviors in 138 video-recorded scientific team meetings. Each meeting is approximately one hour long and includes four to seven scientists from diverse backgrounds at scientific conferences. We investigate the inter-rater reliability of a human expert’s and Gemini’s annotations and qualitatively investigate the differences. Our work bridges computational methods and team science, offering a framework to help CSS researchers study how micro-level behaviors (e.g., conflict management) predict macro-level outcomes like innovation. Using an authoritative framework developed by Salazar and colleagues [4], we created a coding scheme with six team processes (e.g., communication practices and conflict management) that are further broken down into 23 observable behaviors (e.g., “invite input from others” and “express agreement”). We prompted the Gemini model (‘gemini-1.5-pro’) with the coding scheme and few-shot examples to annotate behaviors, actors, timestamps, and explanations. Annotating actors of behaviors allows us to distinguish each team member’s behavior, while including explanations enables qualitative investigation of differences between Gemini’s and the human’s annotations. We then took a random sample of 25 videos (~20%) to obtain annotations from a human expert who has over five years of experience studying teams and conducting qualitative analysis. The human expert was provided with the same coding scheme and instructions. To evaluate inter-rater reliability, we calculated Cohen’s Kappa (𝜅), a standard metric for evaluating agreements between multiple coders [3]. For comparability with prior evaluations of AI annotation capabilities [1], we also report F1 scores using the expert’s annotations as ground truth. To further analyze discrepancies, we qualitatively examined 60 annotations across all codes, randomly sampling 30 with high inter-rater reliability and 30 with low reliability. These annotations, along with corresponding video segments and explanations, were analyzed in detail. In a pilot study, we prompted the Gemini model to annotate one video and assessed inter-rater reliability. While Gemini and the human expert achieved near-perfect agreement on actors (𝜅 = 0.86), the average Cohen’s Kappa for team processes was 0.447, indicating moderate agreement. As shown in Table 2, agreement was highest for “Trust and psychological safety” (𝜅 = 0.612, substantial agreement) and lowest for “Shared goal and problem focus” (𝜅 = 0.287, fair agreement). F1 scores mirrored this trend, averaging 0.531. Qualitative analysis revealed higher agreement for codes with clear definitions (e.g., “express agreement”) and lower agreement for ambiguous or overlapping codes. For instance, “summarize” (condensing key points) and “repeat or rephrase” (restating others’ words) were interpreted inconsistently, while “propose different ideas” (new suggestions) and “build on others’ ideas” (extending existing ideas) required contextual nuance to distinguish novelty from iteration. Our findings underscore the transformative promise of multimodal AI in advancing team science and CSS research. While Gemini demonstrates remarkable reliability in annotating actors and specific behaviors (e.g., ""ask questions""), its current limitations in contextual ambiguity—such as distinguishing ""summarize"" from ""repeat or paraphrase""—highlight both challenges and opportunities. By refining coding schemes and scaling our approach to 138 interdisciplinary teams, this work paves the way for unprecedented studies of innovation dynamics: tracking how micro-level behaviors like conflict resolution evolve over time, comparing collaboration patterns across global contexts, or designing AI-augmented tools to nudge teams toward more effective practices. Crucially, by open-sourcing our prompts and annotations, we aim to catalyze a paradigm shift in CSS—from labor-intensive manual coding to scalable, reproducible behavioral analysis. This research not only bridges AI and team science but also unlocks the potential to decode the ""black box"" of collaboration, offering actionable insights for fostering innovation in an increasingly interdisciplinary world.","Evey Jiaxin Huang, Matthew Groh, Daniel Abrams, Brian Uzzi",Troselli,Image as Data,6,,763

Public attention, and the formation of opinions about the ongoing conflict, is an important object of study, as it underpins serious national policy decisions of other nations, especially those in Europe. In this study, we ask, to what extent is the public attention across Europe about the Ukraine war synchronized, and is it catalyzed by specific events? Further, can we identify opinion ""communities"" within each country that have distinct stances on relevant issues, and are there opinions that are shared across such communities internationally? We use a collection of 165M tweets to reveal opinion communities in 20 European countries in the first 7 months of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. We find that among a synchrony of Europe's public attention to the war are communities that disagree on key issues concerning the conflict, such as whether to send military aid to Ukraine, or to sanction Russia. Furthermore, these stances are related to the temporal attention patterns each community. Also, we find an initial period of lowered structural polarization that suggests a greater diversity of interaction, before the communities coalesce. We believe the international perspective offered by this study brings to light important opinion dynamics concerning the Russo-Ukrainian conflict.","Yelena Mejova, Arthur Thomas Edward Capozzi Lupi, Corrado Monti, Gianmarco De Francisci Morales",Vingen 1+2,Political Narratives I,1,,457

We develop a computational approach to measure metaphorical language, focusing on immigration discourse on social media. Grounded in qualitative social science research, we identify seven concepts evoked in immigration discourse (e.g. water or vermin). We propose and evaluate a novel technique that leverages both word-level and document-level signals to measure metaphor with respect to these concepts. We then study the relationship between metaphor, political ideology, and user engagement in 400K US tweets about immigration. While conservatives tend to use dehumanizing metaphors more than liberals, this effect varies widely across concepts. Moreover, creature-related metaphor is associated with more retweets, especially for liberal authors. Our work highlights the potential for computational methods to complement qualitative approaches in understanding subtle and implicit language in political discourse.","Julia Mendelsohn, Ceren Budak",Vingen 1+2,Political Narratives I,2,,927

As recent attacks on democratic checks and balances are being recast as necessary reforms against a compromised system by Trump and his supporters, we can see how these rumors continue to shape American politics today. However, we believe these rumors are only one part of a wider constellation of narratives that crystallized on Twitter in that period and which have been instrumental in diminishing trust in the state and democratic institutions. One such narrative, which we identified in a preliminary study, is that of a covert unethical relationship between Joe Biden and China, however other examples abound. Understanding this wider constellation of narratives is crucial for making sense of the real-world events surrounding both the 2020 and 2024 presidential elections. In this research project, we set out to analyze an extensive dataset of 2.4 billion tweets collected from November 2019 to October 2022 in order to inductively identify key narratives that spread on Twitter during this period, and the online communities that engaged with them. Our methodological approach combines social network analysis, hierarchical topic modelling and claim detection and will allow us to 1) provide a more complete account of the discursive climate on Twitter around the 2020 elections, 2) investigate the role of media and other key actors in creating, amplifying and spreading narratives and 3) examine the co-constitution and co-evolution of narratives and networks over time.","Sandrine Lara Chausson, Marion Fourcade, David Harding, Björn Ross",Vingen 1+2,Political Narratives I,6,,389

Recognizing the influence of defectors in shaping policy outcomes is crucial, because a few well-placed votes can tip the balance of power. Research suggests that each vote requires a representative to weigh personal values against their party’s wishes. However, a measurement for party pressure – the strength of parties to convince their representatives to vote according to party line – remains elusive. This paper uses transcripts of Congressional floor speeches in a text-analytical model to understand vote defection and party pressure. In floor speeches, representatives signal and justify their intent of defection to their peers. By transforming speeches into word embeddings and calculating the cosine similarity between them, this paper proxies speech similarity and tests three related hypotheses. First, speech similarity predicts vote similarity. Second, defectors will deviate from their party’s speeches more than those who don’t. Third, depending on the vote outcome, defectors will change their tone depending on the amount of party pressure. Preliminary results support the first hypothesis and show that speech similarity is the strongest predictor of vote agreement after party affiliation.",Hendrik Erz,Vingen 1+2,Political Narratives II,2,,172

In both cases, we use the geographic differences to build the political spaces for the voters. As a consequence, we only see differences that are not equally distributed geographically. For the Swiss public votes we used two data sets: A data set containing the results for the 2222 Swiss communities for the 325 nation-wide votes from 1981 to 2018 by SOTOMO (https://www.sotomo.ch) (see also Hermann & Leuthold (2001)) for an analysis of the data until 2000) and the results of the votes at the level of cantons for 1950 - 2023 from Swissvotes (https://swissvotes.ch) . In this abstract, we show only the results for the latter. The second data set were the results for all Swiss communities for all nation wide elections (Swiss Parliament, ""Nationalrat"") from 1971 - 2023 (https://www.bfs.admin.ch/asset/de/28725591). Methods: We performed a weighted principal component analysis on the data. For the Swiss votes, a single data point is the vector of the percentages of yes votes in one community for all votes in a 10-year time window. For the elections, it is the vector of the percentages of votes for each party in one community. The weights were the sum of votes within one community or canton. In order to assess the dimensionality we estimated the percentages of explained variance by the first three principal components as a function over time. The less components you need to explain a certain part of the variance, for instance 70\%, the lower the dimensionality of the space. For the public vote data we used a sliding window of 10 years with a step size of one year, while the PCA for the national elections was performed for each election occurring every four years. Results and Discussion: The first three principal components explained most of the variance in both datasets. For the public votes we find a decline of variance explained by the first principal component together with an increase in the second component starting at the beginning of the 1970s and lasting until the beginning of the 90s, when the dynamics reversed. For this period Hermann and Leuthold (2001) identified three main dimensions spanning the corresponding Swiss political space, left---right, liberal---conservative and technocratic---ecological. In particular, the third dimension corresponded to new topics related to environmental protection and ecological questions. However, starting from 1990 the importance of the second dimension diminished, resulting in a political space that becomes nearly one-dimensional, with the first component accounting for almost 70\% of the variance. One explanation could be the SVP's rise from 11.9\% of the votes in 1991 to 26.8\% in 2003, becoming the strongest party, in particular, because the SVP used public votes for mobilization along their preferred topics such as restricting migration. In order to check this hypothesis we performed a similar analysis for the data from Swiss national elections. Here, the picture is partially different: we do not see any significant changes until 1990. Moreover, the rise of the SVP is accompanied by a pattern of de-alignment similar to the one observed for the vote data 15 years earlier. Only after 2007, we see an increase in the first and a decrease in the second principal component, similar to the public votes after 1990. This delay may reflect how direct democracy, with public votes, responds faster to emerging issues than party programs, causing a lag in party positions. The political spaces for elections and votes for the 1980s (left panels) are structurally very different. In the political space of the national elections we observe basically two groups that form two one-dimensional ""arms"" in the PCA embedding, corresponding to two traditional types of party systems in Switzerland: (1) the cantons dominated by the Christian Democrats: “In these cantons, the traditional confessional conflict between the Christian Democrats and their liberal counterparts still determines the political disputes”, (2) the confessionally mixed German-speaking Swiss cantons where ""a relatively strong left-wing party opposes the Free Democrats on the one hand and the SVP on the other"" \cite{kriesi2005aufstieg}. The embeddings estimated from the public votes show first the language clusters (German, French and Italian) and an urban-rural gradient within the clusters (big cities on the left). In the more recent spaces both spaces are less clearly structured, but still quite different. However, at both time points the urban-rural divide is a main element in the first component, especially in elections, this can be directly linked to the opposition between the SVP (strong in rural areas) and the left parties (social democrats and green party, strong in larger cities).",Eckehard Olbrich,Vingen 1+2,Political Narratives II,5,,972

Using a large dataset of tweets from 2021 to 2023 where previous work has shown strong evidence for issue alignment, we use a graph-based approach to extract traces of narratives from tweets of opposing camps to shed light on the following questions: What are the main narratives connected to each issue? How are these different issues woven together? Can we identify meta-narratives that are at the origin of a larger ideological divide? We demonstrate the method on two examples, Covid and climate change, where we expose diverging narratives around vaccines, masks, trust in science, and freedom and regulations.

Two principal corpora were compiled: (1) a set of autobiographical texts from Nazi supporters and (2) a comparison collection of writings by ordinary Germans from the same period. We employed large language models (LLMs) to extract childhood-related passages—while filtering out overt political content—thereby producing standardized “snippets” for analysis. These snippets were then evaluated using supervised machine learning models to classify each passage as either Nazi-supporting or non-Nazi. Our findings reveal that childhood narratives alone achieve over 70% classification accuracy, suggesting that references to educational setbacks, communal values, and work-related aspirations can reliably predict later political alignment. This outcome challenges long-standing theories that primarily link extremist support to authoritarian parenting and punitive childhood environments. While such themes do appear, many autobiographies from Nazi supporters instead underscore schooling deficits and collective obligations—rather than rigid discipline—as central influences. By framing corpus membership as a classification task, this study introduces a novel computational approach to text-based political analysis. Although centered on a specific historical context, these insights have broader implications for understanding how personal narratives may signal ideological commitments across diverse sociopolitical settings.","Hans-Joachim Voth, Vasiliki Fouka, Dominik Loibner",Vingen 1+2,Political Narratives II,7,,989

Traditional difficulties in achieving such an objective include the costs of conducting large transnational surveys and designing them with meaningful dimensions for self-placement of respondents. While respondents from different countries can be prompted to position themselves on relevant dimensions, e.g., a Left-Right dimension, it remains difficult to compare self-positioning across countries. Furthermore, while individuals might display coherent spatial references (e.g., between self-positioning, how they perceive candidates and parties, and how they vote), the dimensions that yield coherent spatial positions might not always iden- tify clear policy positions (e.g., on immigration, environmental protection, or education, and on which individuals might be less knowledgeable). Prominent instruments that target these challenges are the European Social Survey (ESS), or the Eurobarometer, which are limited, however, to an European scope. To our knowledge, no global quantitative measurement of po- larization exists; either at the country level nor at the individual level. A prominent candidate solution for some of these ills is to use scaling of behavioral data to passively estimate position of individuals on relevant ideological and issue dimensions (Imai, Lo, and Olmsted 2016). A promising data source capturing relevant behavior are social media platforms, and in particular those entangled with political communication, and having a large user base in several countries, such as X/Twitter. While several proposals have performed ide- ology scaling of X/Twitter data (Barbera ́ 2015; Barbera ́ et al. 2015), they have mostly focused on a single country (and disproportionately the US), solving identification problems in the in- ference in a way that hinders comparability across countries, fixing the center of ideological scales inferred at the mean of the sample. Furthermore, most methods are designed to capture the main ideology dimension structuring national politics, which might vary across countries, and might not consist of the same structure of aligned issues (despite having a shared name, such as Left-Right, or Liberal-Conservative dimension). A more recent proposition by Ramaciotti Morales et al. 2023 combined multidimensional scaling of X/Twitter data with political survey data to calibrate ideology and issue dimen- sions, solving the identification problems of the inference of positions by fixing reference points present in surveys (e.g., positions of political parties) along comparable dimensions. Building on this approach, we propose a method to position individuals from tens of countries in nearly all continents in comparable ideology and issue dimensions, providing the first global atlas of polarization. Following the research design of Ramaciotti Morales et al. 2023 we collected the more than 100M followers of Members of Parliament (MPs) on X/Twitter in 2023 on 34 countries, and computed a multidimensional scaling producing a latent space for users, including MPs. We then created proxy positions for parties as the mean position of MPs grouped by party, and used party positions to map every user in the latent space onto the issue and ideology dimensions of the Global Party Survey (GPS; Norris 2020). This allowed us to position all X/Twitter users in our extensive multi-national sample on comparable dimensions, including relevant ones such as the GPS Left-Right dimension. Once the cross-national positioning of individuals was validated, we proceeded to measure Left-Right polarization on each country using the Duclos-Esteban-Ray (DER) measure on the distributions of the populations. The DER measure is an index that captures both the degree to which a distribution is concentrated around attractors, and the distance between the position of attractors or modes (Duclos, Esteban, and Ray 2006). We provide an atlas of the world colored according to the degree of polarization, as measured by the DER measure, on our pop- ulation of users connected to MPs in each country. Our results conform to the expectations set by previous research in the EU (Caravaca et al. 2022), but extends the comparability of coun- tries to provide in trans-continental perspective, including most of the Americas. Our results show that the US X/Twitter-sphere is far more polarized than that of other countries, more than doubling the value of the DER measure in comparison to almost all European countries.",Pedro Ramaciotti Morales,Troselli,Polarization I,1,,227

This comparative study proposes standardized, network-based measures to capture three key dimensions of polarization—constraint, sorting, and disagreement. We introduce a belief network approach, which conceptualizes an individual’s belief system as a network of interconnected attitudes and identities. In such belief networks, the nodes represent specific political issues or identities, and the edges denote the regularized partial correlations between the distributions of opinions on these entities. Using data from the World Values Survey (WVS) and the European Values Study (EVS) from 2017–2023 in 78 countries, we found that constraint and sorting exhibit a high level of correlation, but disagreement shows different patterns. We further consider how various macro-level factors explain these dimensions of polarization. Our results reveal the multidimensional nature of mass polarization, highlighting this global phenomenon may have various substantiations and structural mechanisms.","Yufan Guo, Yilang Peng, Tian Yang",Troselli,Polarization I,2,,513
2025-07-24 11:00:00,2025-07-24 12:30:00,session_presentation,The emergence of polarised groups through source filtering,"Societies worldwide often display multi-dimensional ideological divides that extend across unrelated topics, from environmental policy to vaccine safety. Existing explanations for such polarisation sometimes hinge on strong assumptions (e.g., irrational learning, negative updating) or yield weaker forms of disagreement. In contrast, we develop a computational framework showing how *source filtering*, in which agents accept or reject new beliefs based on their trust in the information source, can drive beliefs to cluster into tightly correlated, opposing packages, even when those beliefs are intrinsically unrelated. By comparing this with *content filtering*, where agents focus on a belief’s intrinsic coherence, we find that source filtering more readily generates two dominant, polarised “camps”. Mathematical models and agent-based simulations confirm that random interactions can quickly yield stark polarisation, suggesting a mechanism akin to algorithmic bias on social media platforms (e.g., collaborative filtering) that may further reinforce these ideological bundlings. Crucially, the theory equips computational social science with a basis for interpreting large-scale social data, especially from social media, by clarifying how platform-driven interactions can systematically bundle otherwise unrelated viewpoints and exacerbate polarisation at scale.",Fredrik Jansson,Troselli,Polarization I,3,,567

In recent years, social media and the Internet have been blamed for spreading toxic and extremist discourse. Previous research shows that strong partisans tend to be more politically interested, informed, and mobilized [Taber and Lodge, 2006]. However, we still know very little about the pathways and types of information sources accessed by individuals who position themselves on the far ends of the left-right scale. In this paper, we examine the information consumption habits of individuals with different ideological leanings. Using panel survey data and web-tracking data from 893 individuals in Spain, collected one month before and after the 2023 General Election, we analyze all political content individuals were exposed to in newspapers (N10,000) and social media (N20,000) using Large Language Models (LLMs). Second, we analyze information pathways resorting to Markov chains, thereby identifying differential patterns among far-right, far-left, and the remaining population. Previous research also shows that civil (rather than uncivil) political content and interactions via news media or social networks favor information seeking and tend to invigorate political participation [Papacharissi, 2002, Schudson, 2002]. However, online incivility increases certain forms of political engagement by reinforcing partisan identity [Coe et al., 2014], and a hostile opinion climate has been shown to increase participation among those who see themselves in a minority [Abts et al., 2024, Madriaza et al., 2025]. For those in like-minded social media environments, incivility can be mobilizing, acting as a signal that alerts in-group individuals that something important is at stake [Kosmidis and Theocharis, 2020]. Preliminary results indicate that far-right individuals consume less political content than the average respondent, consuming, in relative terms, a greater amount of extremist media and influencers, as shown in figure 1. The growing importance of influencers to far-right strategic communication has been highlighted by [Edgerly et al., 2017]. Moreover, far-right individuals are more likely than the average user to turn to social media after visiting legacy or political sites or searching for political content on search engines [Figure 3]. In contrast, far-left individuals tend to continue informing themselves through similar sources [Figure 4]. These findings reveal that individual ideological differences can lead to distinct information pathways, which not only shape the type of political content consumed but also have varying potential to fuel polarization, reinforce ideological echo chambers, and hinder meaningful debate across political divides, ultimately influencing both political engagement and polarization. Dependent variables: Average index political participation, measured by responses to how often individuals engaged in activities such as electoral campaigns, protests, civic engagement, online participation, and used sources like legacy media, extremist sites, and political influencers. Method II: Inclusion criteria for media outlets: Extremist media outlets are characterized by ideological bias and ethical violations, including failure to verify sources and anti-establishment positions, which compromise journalistic integrity. Legacy media outlets, on the other hand, adhere to journalistic standards, and avoid clear ideological bias.","Alejandro De la fuente Cuesta, Laia Castro Herrero, Yuan Zhang, Frank Esser, Jihye Park, Pamina Syed Al, Michael Amsler",Troselli,Polarization I,4,,523

While research on deliberative decision-making highlights the potential of deliberation to foster mutual understanding, we still lack insights into how partisan identities function as social markers that influence citizen' opinion formation in deliberative contexts and shape their willingness to consider alternative perspectives. Drawing on social identity theory and the role of social norms, we hypothesize that citizens' support for policy proposals and their readiness to engage in deliberative discourse are influenced by the partisan identity of the policy proponent. To test this argument, we implement a large-scale, pre-registered visual conjoint experiment, leveraging computational text analysis to examine deliberative engagement. Our study, conducted in Germany—a country experiencing increasing affective polarization—emulates the online citizens' assembly Conference on the Future of the EU to provide an externally valid measure of partisan bias in deliberation. Our results show that when the out-partisan identity of a policy proponent is made salient, individuals are more likely to dismiss the policy proposal, even when they substantively agree with it. By integrating experimental and computational methods, this study sheds light on how affective polarization constrains citizens' willingness to engage with policy proposals from out-party members despite ideological alignment. These findings contribute to our understanding of the challenges to effective deliberation and inclusive democratic discourse in Western European societies while offering methodological insights for studying online deliberation in polarized contexts.","Julia Schulte-Cloos, Daniel Bischof, Roman Senninger",Troselli,Polarization I,5,,733
2025-07-24 11:00:00,2025-07-24 12:30:00,session_presentation,The Effects of Outgroup Agreement and Ingroup Dissent on Political Polarization,"Global polarization has intensified in recent years, driven in part by the growing influence of social media. Users’ preference to engage with like-minded online content creates echo chambers that segregate them into increasingly polarized groups. Content curation algorithms further reinforce this divide, deepening affective polarization. A key issue with these algorithms is content ranking based on predicted engagement. High-arousal posts, both positive and negative, tend to stimulate engagement. As a result, algorithms that focus on maximizing engagement prioritize these posts, inadvertently distorting political perceptions. On one hand, they amplify positive content from the ingroup, reinforcing a false sense of homogeneity. On the other hand, they highlight negative content from the outgroup, exaggerating the perceived extremism of opposing viewpoints. Given these dynamics, interventions that reshape how individuals perceive political divisions may help reduce polarization. Strategies that reshape perceptions of outgroups include introducing counter-stereotypical information, correcting false perceptions, recategorizing social identities, and facilitating intergroup contact. Research suggests these interventions can reduce partisan hostility, but their long-term impact on intergroup attitudes and whether they foster positive cross-partisan interactions remains uncertain, as they typically involve brief, one-time exposures within surveys. Polarization is shaped not only by passive exposure to information but also by social interactions that actively reinforce perceptions of “us” versus “them.” While field interventions that target intergroup interactions have shown lasting effects that promote cooperative behaviors, they are less scalable. We propose a study design utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate real-time discussions, allowing us to test how political conversations can mitigate partisan divides. We hypothesize that encountering unexpected experiences, such as finding common ground with a political opponent (Outgroup Agreement) or disagreement with a political ingroup member (Ingroup Disagreement), can trigger cognitive dissonance and a reassessment of partisan boundaries, ultimately reducing political polarization. Unlike one-off informational exposure, which may produce short-term attitude shifts, engaging in dialogue—particularly when it involves ingroup disagreement or outgroup agreement—has the potential to challenge entrenched partisan perceptions, leading to enduring attitude changes. To test these hypotheses, we employ LLM-embedded survey experiments. Participants will be recruited via quota-based sampling and randomly assigned to one of four conditions in a 2×2 factorial design: (1) Ingroup Agreement (discussion with a like-minded ingroup member), (2) Ingroup Disagreement (discussion with an ingroup member who disagrees), (3) Outgroup Agreement (discussion with an outgroup member who agrees), or (4) Outgroup Disagreement (discussion with an outgroup member who disagrees). Participants will engage in real-time conversations with LLM personas, believing they are interacting with another randomly matched participant. These LLM personas are dynamically customized based on each participant’s pre-treatment responses (e.g., opinions on key political issues) and their assigned experimental condition. For instance, if a Democratic participant who opposes immigration restrictions is assigned to the Outgroup Agreement condition, the LLM persona will be given a Republican identity that also disagrees with immigration restrictions. This alignment is generated within the system prompt, where the persona’s partisan identity (ingroup vs. outgroup) and stance (agreement vs. disagreement) are inserted into predefined templates based on the participant’s responses and assigned experimental condition. After completing the discussion with the LLM persona, participants will answer post-treatment questionnaires measuring outcome variables. To assess whether the effects of political discussion persist over time, participants will be invited to a follow-up survey four weeks later. We provide empirical evidence on how political conversations—specifically, experiences of outgroup agreement and ingroup disagreement—can mitigate polarization. By leveraging LLM-driven dialogues within a survey framework, this research offers a scalable and controlled approach to studying depolarization strategies in digital environments. Beyond its experimental contribution, the findings have practical implications for social media interventions. If ingroup disagreement reduces the false perception of ingroup uniformity, this suggests that social media algorithms could be designed to prioritize diverse perspectives within the ingroup. Similarly, if cross-party agreement helps reduce polarization, emphasizing shared values and common ground in algorithmic content curation could help bridge partisan divides.","Do Won Kim, Bao Tran Truong, Ozgur Can Seckin, Saumya Bhadani",Troselli,Polarization I,6,,665

2025-07-24 14:30:00,2025-07-24 16:00:00,session_presentation,How opinion variation among in-groups can skew perceptions of ideological polarisation,"There is a widespread perception that society has been polarising into groups with increasingly divergent opinions. Multiple studies have sought to quantify the degree of opinion divergence (or ideological polarisation), typically relying on differences between self-reported opinions, and have reached mixed conclusions. We propose this inconsistency can be explained by the way individuals' subjective perceptions are shaped by their social identities. We introduce a formal framework to analyse opinion data that accounts for such asymmetric, dynamic perceptions. When members of an in-group become increasingly homogeneous on a given topic (that is, when the variance of opinions in that group decreases), they perceive deviant opinions as increasingly distant from their own. Consequently, these individuals may perceive greater polarisation than an objective, neutral observer would. Applying the framework to data on the opinions of Germans about climate change, we show that perceived polarisation may depend as much on the dynamics of in-group variance as it does on actual opinion divergence in society. Moreover, we show that the direction of this effect may vary over time and across different partisan groups. Our framework offers an explanation why people might sometimes perceive higher levels of ideological polarisation than surveys indicate, independent of social segregation, polarisation-enforcing cognitive biases, or affect-driven attitudes towards out-groups.","Peter Steiglechner, Paul E.

2025-07-24 14:30:00,2025-07-24 16:00:00,session_presentation,Facing Common Threats in a Polarized Environment,"When facing a common threat, conventional wisdom suggests that members of a society will be able to set aside their differences and work together towards a collective solution. However, that this axiom is universal has been disproven by the disjointed and highly polarized responses to COVID-19 and the threat of climate change in the United States. Previous research has suggested that conditions are unfavorable for collective response, citing high levels of affective polarization, i.e., partisan dislike of members of the other party, low information and subsequent overreliance on social learning, and divisive influence by political elites. We synthesize these concepts into a mathematical model of opinion dynamics and evaluate different scenarios under which feedback between affective and ideological polarization may evolve. Under different specifications for social learning, initial polarization (representing, e.g., early influence by political elites), and inherent preferences between groups, the model predicts three behaviors. In a scenario with a high degree of social learning and high initial polarization, a common threat can deepen existing division, even when inherent preferences are equal between two groups. When initial polarization is lower, groups can reach consensus on the common threat, and when reliance on social learning is reduced and inherent preferences are more disparate, the consensus reached on the common threat can reduce polarization on pre-existing issues. This study helps solve the puzzle of why common, existential threats like COVID-19 and climate change are not guaranteed to unite polarized groups and suggests potential high-leverage intervention points to facilitate collective problem-solving.","Cathy DiGennaro, Vicky Chuqiao Yang",Troselli,Polarization II,2,,922

The undertaking of several studies of political phenomena in social media mandates the operationalization of the notion of political stance of users and contents involved. Relevant examples include the study of segregation and polarization online, or the study of political diversity in content diets in social media. While many research designs rely on operationalizations best suited for the US setting, few allow addressing more general design, in which users and content might take stances on multiple ideology and issue dimensions, going beyond traditional Liberal-Conservative or Left-Right scales. To advance the study of more general online ecosystems, we present a methodology for the computation of multidimensional political positions of social media users and web domains. We perform a case study on a large-scale X/Twitter population of users in the French political Twittersphere and web domains, embedded in a political space spanned by dimensions measuring attitudes towards immigration, the EU, liberal values, elites and institutions, nationalism and the environment. We provide several benchmarks validating the positions of these entities (based on both LLM and human annotations), as well as a discussion of the case studies in which they can be used, including, e.g., AI explainability, political polarization and segregation, and media diets.

2025-07-24 14:30:00,2025-07-24 16:00:00,session_presentation,Measuring the effect of Ownership Concentration on News Publication Practices,"The concentration of news media ownership is increasing globally. Through complex legal agreements between broadcasting companies, publishers may give up varying levels of editorial control in order to offset the costs of production involved in less profitable markets. On the other hand, they may gain control of additional news outlets in order to increase their effective market share in areas where FCC regulations on audience reach limits are not enforceable. This is done through a mixture of mergers, acquisitions, affiliations, sister channels, and shared-services agreements. In many cases, it has been found that news domains converge to the content of the broadcasting company that acquires them. Despite this, little can be said about the measurable effects of ownership concentration on news publication practices. We hypothesize that increased ownership concentration of news media leads to a decline in pluralism and a concentration of news content. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel network method that allows us to correlate ownership concentration at the organizational level with changes in news content production. Our network method defines a distance measure over empirically observed event co-coverage and citation networks between US news domains. We then determine how far the observed networks are from a worst case scenario (complete concentration). To support the feasibility of this approach, we present preliminary analysis on GDELT and CommonCrawl datasets, and propose the use of our metric as a longitudinal measure of news content concentration.","Peter Carragher, Kathleen M.

2025-07-24 14:30:00,2025-07-24 16:00:00,session_presentation,Neural Network Nominate: Mapping Mass Political Ideology via Revealed Preferences,"Political polarization poses a growing threat to democracies by weakening civic engagement, institutional trust, and effective governance (McCoy & Somer, 2019). Yet many studies on mass-level polarization rely on social media data (Del Vicario et al., 2016; Conover et al., 2021), which can be skewed by echo chambers and platform biases (Hargittai, 2015), or on survey-based self-reports (Tourangeau & Yan, 2007), which are vulnerable to social desirability and other response biases. To address these issues, we introduce Neural Network Nominate (NNN), a framework that infers political ideology from revealed preferences—direct policy choices—rather than solely from stated opinions. NNN builds on Thurstone’s (1927) method of paired comparisons and adapts the NOMINATE approach (Poole & Rosenthal, 2001) from legislative roll-call data to large-scale individual-level datasets. Our method simultaneously embeds both voters and policy proposals in a low-dimensional space, creating a shared ideological map. We tested this approach in three distinct contexts: Chile (2019) with three million pairwise comparisons submitted by 48,000 participants during a period of intense social unrest, France (2022) with two million comparisons from 1,488 participants in the lead-up to the presidential election and Brazil (2022) with around 277,000 comparisons from 790 participants during the presidential election. In each setting, participants saw pairs of policy proposals and indicated which proposal they preferred, after which they could optionally provide self-reported ideology (left–right) and basic demographics (Figure 1-a). We applied bot-detection criteria (Awad et al., 2018; Navarrete et al., 2023) and then trained a neural network classifier to predict which proposal would win in each pair—achieving predictive accuracies of about 68–70%. The network features two embedding matrices (one for users, another for proposals). By adjusting these embeddings to minimize prediction error, the model learns a latent ideological space in which each user and each proposal occupies coordinates in a two-dimensional space. After learning the embeddings (Figure1-b), we examined how well a user’s coordinates could predict self-reported left–right ideology. When combined with minimal demographic data, we classified left- vs. right-leaning users with 83% accuracy in Chile, 91% in France, and 86% in Brazil (Figure 1-d,e). Visualizing these coordinates revealed coherent clusters of users and proposals: left-leaning participants clustered near left-leaning proposals, right-leaning participants near right-leaning proposals, and so on (Figure 1-c). Sensitivity analyses showed that even after only 20 pairwise comparisons per user, NNN could still classify political leanings with about 77–82% accuracy. Generational patterns emerged across countries. In France and Brazil, younger cohorts (Millennials and Generation Z) formed more polarized “peaks,” aligning with research suggesting stronger ideological intensity among “digital natives” (Twenge et al., 2019). In contrast, in the Chilean sample—collected amid widespread protests—self-identified younger right-wing participants gravitated somewhat leftward on certain policy choices, pointing to a more fluid ideological landscape during a time of social upheaval. Methodologically, NNN overcomes key limitations of standard surveys and social media scraping by using direct policy choices instead of abstract scales or retrospective recall. This approach reduces the impact of social desirability bias, since participants choose between concrete policy proposals rather than rating their positions on sensitive topics. It also avoids platform-driven distortions, since no single social network or curated feed dictates exposure. Furthermore, NNN expands the traditional spatial-voting paradigm—which typically focuses on legislative elites—to broader populations. By systematically placing both people and proposals in the same ideological space, we gain clearer insights into which policies unite or divide voters at the mass level. This can illuminate not just how polarized a population is but also why it is polarized, by identifying the specific proposals that drive ideological cleavages. In sum, our findings demonstrate that pairing a neural network architecture with revealed preferences offers a scalable, transparent means of tracking polarization and understanding how specific policy choices shape ideological divides. By capturing actual decisions rather than stated views, this framework complements or, in some cases, outperforms conventional surveys and social media analyses. The results point toward promising avenues for “digital democracy,” where participants can discover consensus points, highlight entrenched fault lines, and surface emerging issues with fewer biases than in traditional data-collection methods.","Adolfo Fuentes-Jofre, Cristian E Candia, Cristian Jara-Figueroa",Troselli,Polarization II,6,,76

Persuading climate skeptics is essential for building broader support for stronger climate policies and accelerating efforts to mitigate climate change. However, outreach efforts often depend on perceptions of skeptics' openness to climate communication: when persuasion is seen as unlikely, communication efforts tend to diminish. In this paper, we investigate the predicted versus actual impact of climate change information on skeptics. Using a series of surveys with U.S. respondents, we first gather predictions about the effectiveness of authentic news articles in changing skeptics' views. Our findings reveal a widespread pessimism: climate advocates expect no change in attitudes, while skeptics anticipate a backfire effect that reinforces their skepticism. Contrary to these predictions, our preregistered survey experiment finds that exposure to climate change articles significantly increases concern among skeptics. However, their responses vary in terms of willingness to adopt climate-friendly behaviors and support climate policies. These results reveal a significant disconnect between people's expectations and actual effects of climate communication on skeptics, emphasizing the need for sustained and strategic investments in climate communication to foster greater public engagement and support for climate action.","Amir Tohidi Kalorazi, Stefano Balietti, Samuel Fraiberger, Anca Balietti",Troselli,Polarization II,7,,912

We use open human mobility data from passive and active mobile network connections covering 13 million individuals in Spain (27\% of the population) to examine extreme heat's impact on mobility. We stratify by age, gender, social and economic status, and activity. Our findings show activity falls by as much as 10% on hot days generally and 20% on hot afternoons specifically, when temperatures peak. Individuals cut infrequent activities most, frequent ones less, and rarely skip work. Further differences emerge on hot days. Older adults are more likely to avoid work related travel and cut back on other activities, while those earning less are less able to reduce work related mobility.

Their growth and development are closely tied to urban population distribution and mobility. Changes in accessibility influence both the prosperity of existing commercial centers and the emergence of new ones. Thus, quantifying accessibility is essential for understanding the spatial structure of commercial districts and their transformation over time. Traditional accessibility indicators, such as network density or distance to transit stations, often emphasize physical distance rather than consumer experience~\cite{heroy2023neighbourhood}. However, to better understand the relationship between consumer distribution, mobility patterns, and commercial district development, accessibility must be measured as it is actually experienced. Furthermore, variations between distance-based and time-based accessibility, influenced by transport infrastructure, should be considered. This study develops a multidimensional accessibility index using real-time movement data from GPS-based navigation systems and mapping services. The proposed index integrates physical distance-based accessibility, travel time-based accessibility, and public transportation accessibility for a comprehensive assessment of commercial district accessibility. Additionally, population distribution data is incorporated to reflect consumer density, ensuring accessibility measures align with consumer demand and commercial district activity. Using floating population data, we empirically analyze the relationship between commercial district accessibility and the spatial distribution of potential consumers through regression analysis. The study focuses on commercial districts in Incheon, South Korea, a rapidly developing mid-sized Asian city. Incheon features both traditional commercial hubs and newly developed business districts, making it an ideal case for examining accessibility’s impact. The boundaries of Incheon’s commercial districts are defined using the methodology of~\cite{jun2022economic}. Within these boundaries, we collect travel time and distance data for approximately 2,000,000 optimal paths from Korean navigation platforms (Naver~\cite{naver_directions}, Kakao~\cite{kakao_directions}), covering both driving and public transportation. Additionally, floating population data and credit card transaction records are used to investigate the relationship between accessibility and visitor flow patterns. Building on spatial interaction theory~\cite{heroy2023neighbourhood,nyerges2011sage}, we propose a district-focused accessibility index that reflects \textit{accessibility-weighted catchment demand}: \[ A_{z}^{t} = \sum_{i} P_{i} e^{-\frac{c^{t}_{iz}}{\lambda_{t}}} \], where \( A_{z}^{t} \) represents the accessibility of commercial district \( z \) via transportation mode \( t \), \( P_{i} \) denotes the potential consumer population at origin \( i \) (reflecting the \textit{catchment demand}), \( c^{t}_{iz} \) refers to the travel cost from \( i \) to \( z \), and \( \lambda_{t} \) is a decay parameter that reflects sensitivity to travel costs. This approach captures the \textit{effective catchment demand} by incorporating both population size and spatial accessibility. As shown in Figure 1 [A], distance-based accessibility reflects geographical proximity, with higher values near district boundaries. However, time-based accessibility varies due to traffic conditions and infrastructure differences, showing distinct patterns in driving vs. public transportation accessibility. By integrating three accessibility scores, we obtain a comprehensive profile of each commercial district, highlighting differences between newly planned cities and older, organically developed urban centers. In recently developed areas (e.g., \textit{Songdo}), physical distance-based accessibility is low, while time-based accessibility remains high due to well-developed transport infrastructure, though limited public transit weakens external connectivity. Conversely, older urban centers (e.g., \textit{Bupyeong}) show high accessibility in both distance and time-based measures, with traditional commercial districts benefiting from strong public transit access. This study enhances understanding of commercial district accessibility, enabling a more precise quantification of its impact on spatial structure and consumer flow. Moreover, it provides insights into how accessibility attracts visitors, shapes urban mobility trends, and affects commercial revitalization strategies. By revealing the relationship between accessibility and mobility patterns, this research offers valuable implications for urban planning, transportation policy, and sustainable commercial development.","Minjin Lee, Hyoji Choi, Taesung Hwang, Jeong hwan Jeon",Hemeryck,Mobility & Urban Science I,4,,1013
2025-07-22 11:00:00,2025-07-22 12:30:00,session_presentation,Uncovering Urban Lifestyles Through Detailed Large-scale Purchase Records,"Lifestyle encompasses an individual's way of life, including various aspects such as values, social status, consumption habits, and cultural interests. Its multifaceted concept involves complex interactions among these dimensions, making it challenging to measure and capture comprehensively. Recently, there has been a growing consensus that a more direct approach to understanding people’s lifestyles is through the observation of their consumption patterns, which offer explicit insights into their choices, such as what they eat, how they spend their time, and the interests they prioritize. The availability of large-scale purchasing records such as credit card transaction records has enabled data-driven studies on consumption behavior, linked to consumer characteristics. However, while credit card transaction records provide advantages in inferring purchase locations, their lack of information about detailed categories of consumed goods and services limits the ability to comprehensively capture latent lifestyle, which can be represented as a complex composition of purchased items related to socioeconomic status as well as individual preference. Differentiating spending on, for instance, golf gloves versus boxing gloves --- which may signal distinct lifestyles and even socioeconomic statuses --- remains challenging. Here, we extract urban lifestyles using millions of detailed package delivery records from Seoul, Republic of Korea, which span four years. As a global metropolitan city with a diverse mix of social, cultural, and economic backgrounds, Seoul also stands as one of the world’s largest e-commerce markets, with around 80% of its population using online shopping. Our dataset provides granular information on both recipient locations and the specific types of products purchased, allowing us to analyze urban lifestyles in unprecedented detail. Utilizing the data, we capture lifestyle groups consisting of products that are significantly more co-purchased. We apply network analysis and community detection algorithms to generate a co-consumption network of products and identify meaningful lifestyle groups. Moreover, by iterating the community detecting algorithm on a more granular level, we find the hierarchical structure of lifestyles which includes both broad pictures and detailed trends. We further analyze variations in these lifestyle patterns across different urban areas, income levels, and age demographics, highlighting their complex relationships with socioeconomic attributes. In addition, we examine the spatial distribution of lifestyles to assess clustering tendencies. The results show significant spatial autocorrelation, as measured by Moran’s I, indicating that similar lifestyle patterns tend to cluster geographically. This spatial homophily effect has intensified over time, suggesting an increasing alignment of lifestyle behaviors within specific urban areas. This study offers a novel framework for analyzing urban lifestyles through large-scale package delivery data, allowing for a more detailed examination of consumption behavior than traditional methods. By identifying co-purchase patterns and revealing consumer baskets, we uncover distinct lifestyle trends across various socioeconomic groups and demographics, demonstrating the utility of consumption patterns as a proxy for understanding lifestyle choices. Our findings also reveal that lifestyle groups do not align with any single socioeconomic characteristic, underscoring the complex interplay between lifestyle and socioeconomic factors. These insights provide valuable guidance for policymakers, as understanding how urban residents navigate their consumption choices based on lifestyle can inform the development of inclusive, targeted public services and enhance the overall quality of urban life.","Minjin Lee, Hokyun Kim, Bogang Jun, Jaehyuk Park",Hemeryck,Mobility & Urban Science I,5,,508

This body of work has argued that human mobility is scale-free, it has proposed models to generate scale-free moving distance distributions, and explained how the scale-free distribution arises from aggregating displacements across scales. The field of human mobility, however, has not explicitly addressed how mobility is structured by the constraints set by geography – that mobility is shaped by the outlines of landmasses, lakes, and rivers; by the placement of buildings, roadways, and cities. Based on unique datasets capturing millions of moves between precise locations, we show how separating the effect of geography from mobility choices reveals a universal power law spanning five orders of magnitude (10 m to 1,000,000 m). To do so, we incorporate geography via the ‘pair distribution function,’ a fundamental quantity from condensed matter physics that encapsulates the structure of locations on which mobility occurs. We show that this distribution captures the constraints that geography places on human mobility across length scales. Our description conclusively addresses debates between distance-based and opportunity-based perspectives on human mobility: By showing how the spatial distribution of human settlements shapes human mobility, we provide a novel perspective that bridges the gap between these previously opposing ideas.","Louis Boucherie, Benjamin Frank Maier, Sune Lehmann",Hemeryck,Mobility & Urban Science I,6,,55

These types of dataset are generally affected by presence of gaps in individual trajectories which can be due to mobile-phone usage and the data collection process. Sparsity can lead to under-estimate visits to locations and events of potential transmission. Despite the critical role of these datasets for epidemic modeling, the extent to which sparsity can impact the findings of epidemiological studies is not entirely clear [2]. In this study, we propose a data-driven framework in which we can fine-tune the sparsity level in users’ signals to evaluate its effect on descriptive statistics of epidemic modeling simulations.

Our results show that while Chinese cities undergo significant positional shifts, over 80% experience reduced differentiation or remain undifferentiated. Nevertheless, topological data analysis identifies a subset of emerging tech hubs with markedly increased differentiation, driven by advancements in frontier technologies like telecommunications and semiconductors. Compared to their leading U.S. counterparts, these emerging Chinese tech hubs exhibit a faster diversification rate but remain less differentiated overall.

2025-07-22 14:30:00,2025-07-22 16:00:00,session_presentation,Urban scaling and network inequality,"Urban scaling research has documented striking and seemingly universal superlinear relationships between city size and their outputs, from economic productivity and innovation to crime (1-5). Larger cities, across time and space, systematically generate disproportionately more output per capita than smaller ones. Recent studies further show that not only do totals rise with city size, but inequality in these outputs also systematically increases (6-9). Explanations for urban scaling focus on increased social connectivity and economic complexity in dense cities. Simple models of cities as interconnected networks have provided predictions that map remarkably well onto empirical observations of city totals (4,5). However, these models are unable to account for the increases in inequality by city size and instead assume high homogeneity––where everyone is similarly more interconnected and productive in larger cities. Thus, our understanding of the network mechanisms responsible for jointly producing increased productivity and inequality by city size remains poor. To address this gap, we bring together ideas from sociology, network science, and urban economics to identify two network-based mechanisms through which increasing city size produces both higher aggregate output and higher inequality. These mechanisms build on classic sociological theories of social networks—Granovetter’s weak ties (10) and Blau’s social structure (11)—and on economic ideas of skill complementarity (12), embedding them in the context of urban scaling. The first mechanism draws on Blau's theory of social structure, which shows network segregation is governed by heterogeneity, complexity, and consolidation of attributes. When homophilous tie formation occurs alongside correlated social dimensions, networks fragment into clusters, inhibiting diffusion between groups (13-15). For urban scaling, this implies larger cities with greater heterogeneity and stronger consolidation develop more segregated networks. Research confirms bigger cities exhibit greater diversity (16), and our results show increasingly correlated social traits with city size. Consequently, big cities sort individuals into segregated interactions (17), concentrating opportunities among some groups while limiting access for others—simultaneously producing higher citywide output and greater inequality. The second mechanism builds on Granovetter’s insight that “the strength of weak ties” lies in their ability to act as bridges to novel information (10). Large cities are not only more internally diverse; they also provide more opportunities to connect disparate social circles. Prior research (12) shows that big cities facilitate more complementary (and therefore productive) interactions. However, these studies focus on ties defined by frequent interaction within social circles, neglecting the higher-order network connections between such circles. We posit that increased diversity in large cities amplifies benefits from indirect connections. As cities grow, potential weak ties multiply, creating bridges between specialized clusters. Unlike small towns where friends-of-friends resemble immediate circles, big city networks span broader ranges of expertise. This suggests complementarity through longer-range ties scales superlinearly with city size, allowing individuals to access specialized skills through few introductions—contributing to superlinear productivity. This mechanism also generates inequality because advantaged individuals (highly skilled, educated) better recognize and utilize distant network opportunities. They activate weak ties spanning clusters, gaining disproportionately from urban diversity. Less advantaged individuals often lack either the connections or capacity to benefit (12), creating cumulative advantage where network spillovers widen existing gaps. To study these mechanisms, we combine population-scale microdata analysis with agent-based simulations. For the first mechanism, we measure city-specific parameters of Blau’s theory to calibrate simulation models (13-15) for predicting network segregation and inequality, comparing results with empirical observations. For the second mechanism, we analyze skill complementarity across first and second-order ties by educational level. Our results confirm theoretical expectations. In conclusion, this study addresses a critical gap in urban scaling research by identifying network mechanisms that simultaneously produce increased output and inequality. Our preliminary results support these mechanisms, demonstrating how urban network structures differentially distribute opportunities across population segments, contributing to our understanding of cities as complex social systems and offering insights for more inclusive urban policies.","Martin Arvidsson, Marc Keuschnigg",Hemeryck,Mobility & Urban Science II,3,,1046

This study investigates the determinants of remote work adoption in Budapest, Hungary, using mobile phone geolocation data and administrative records of Hungarian companies. By combining these data sources, we analyze how remote work prevalence varies across industries, income groups, and neighborhoods, focusing on spatial and temporal patterns of work activity. We identify three spatial clusters: industrial areas with low economic activity, institutional and commercial hubs with high remote work adoption, and mixed-use areas with diverse working patterns. Regression analyses reveal that higher-income individuals and those in finance-dominated areas are more likely to work remotely, while lower-income individuals, women and those in commerce sectors remain tied to physical workplaces. Proximity to the city center is negatively correlated with remote work, and company productivity measures are positively associated with remote work adoption. This study highlights the unequal distribution of remote work opportunities across socio-economic groups and urban locations, offering valuable insights for policymakers and urban planners in adapting cities to the post-pandemic work environment.","Zsófia Zádor, Balázs Lengyel, Riccardo Di Clemente",Hemeryck,Mobility & Urban Science II,4,,1022
2025-07-22 14:30:00,2025-07-22 16:00:00,session_presentation,The temporal dimension of experienced segregation in cities,"Cities have been traditionally viewed as a great equalizer of economic prosperity, the core mechanism of which is the interactions between people of different demographic characteristics (Jacobs [1984], Jacobs [1969], Florida [2003]). However, a long history of work shows that segregation in cities undercuts this possibility. Recent work has sought to demonstrate the (in)equality in cities using high-resolution mobility data, finding that experiences of segregation extend beyond residential configurations of cities to the everyday interactions between individuals (Moro et al. [2021]). However, these comprehensive studies overlook another dimension recognized to be an important aspect of experience inequality: time (Massey [1994], Netto et al. [2018]). Our study builds on this foundation by empirically measuring space-time inequality using high-resolution mobility data. We leverage anonymized mobility data from Cuebiq to quantify how inequality manifests dynamically across cities, within cities, and between points of interest (POIs). Unlike static segregation metrics, our approach captures fluctuations in socioeconomic integration at different times of day. For instance, POIs that appear integrated at one moment may become highly segregated at another due to shifting activity patterns. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of these temporal dynamics, as changes in work schedules and public space usage fundamentally altered mobility-driven inequality (Santana et al. [2023]). Moreover, recent research suggests that large metropolitan areas, despite their diversity, often exhibit higher exposure segregation due to differentiated space usage across socioeconomic groups (Nilforoshan et al. [2023]). Our work extends these insights by integrating both spatial and temporal dimensions to offer a more comprehensive framework for understanding mobility-driven inequality. Across 11 major US CBSAs, we systematically map the structure of space-time inequality over a six-month period, capturing both weekdays and weekends—in doing so, we document a consistent shape of urban inequality throughout a day. In particular, our results confirm the existence of substantial variation in space-time inequality, beyond typical residential segregation (Fig. 1c). This variation exists on three geographic scales: (1) between cities, (2) within cities, and (3) across POI types. Within cities, we find that greater temporal variation in experienced inequality is negatively correlated with income and positively correlated with diversity—suggesting that neighborhoods with greater resources are insulated from fluctuations in access to amenities and economic activity, while more diverse neighborhoods experience greater shifts in inequality throughout the day. The temporal inequality cataloged in this work emerges from the interplay of where people live, work, and gather—offering valuable insight into how urban form and zoning shape segregation and access to resources. A more detailed understanding of the forces underlying experienced temporal inequality can offer policymakers and community leaders valuable insights about the placement and design of new, inclusive, multi-use spaces—urban POIs that actively counter experienced segregation and reduce disparities in amenity access. In sum, documenting this seemingly universal shape of space-time inequality invites a deeper commitment to reshaping our urban environments and guiding policymakers to design more equitable places to live, work, and connect.","Joshua Rosen, Brennan Klein, Erik Weis, Hamish Gibbs, Daniel O’Brien, Takahiro Yabe, Esteban Moro",Hemeryck,Mobility & Urban Science II,5,,340
2025-07-22 14:30:00,2025-07-22 16:00:00,session_presentation,Urban highways are barriers to social ties,"Cities are hubs of concentrated social capital that can foster diversity and innovation [1]. However, this potential is threatened by spatial fragmentation through built infrastructure that can divide neighborhoods [2, 3], exacerbate inequalities [4, 5], and contribute to segregation [6]. Among various types of barriers fragmenting urban areas, roads designed for motorized traffic are the most ubiquitous, especially highways [7, 8]. Since the 1960s, urban planners have theorized that high-traffic roads reduce opportunities for creating and maintaining social ties across divided neighborhoods [9], thus undermining the social cohesion essential for the development of thriving communities. This premise lies at the core of contemporary urban planning research and interventions [10, 11] that strive to meet the UN’s sustainable development goal of “making cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable” [12]. Despite its significance in urban planning theories, the association between high-traffic roads and reduced social connectivity has never been measured empirically, with the notable exception of a few small-scale, survey-based studies [13, 14]. Previous quantitative research in this area, constrained by the scarcity of geo-referenced social network data [15, 16], has focused instead on measuring socio-economic segregation in cities. This goal has been achieved either by using static demographic data [17, 6] or, more recently, through mobility data [18, 19], with only sporadic attempts to link segregation to urban barriers [20]. While highly valuable, such previous research could not explicitly consider social ties. However, providing an explicit, quantitative estimation of the barrier effect of different roads in curbing social ties is crucial for guiding evidence-based plans of restorative urban interventions and for prioritizing them according to their estimated benefits [21]. To fill this gap, we introduce a method to systematically quantify the association between highways and social ties at multiple scales, ranging from individual highway segments to entire metropolitan areas. We focus on the network of urban highways in the US. This highway network offers a compelling subject for the study of barrier effects: with a cost of at least 1.4 trillion USD [22], US highways were built to bridge city centers and newly created suburbs; simultaneously, they displaced an estimated 1 million people from their neighborhoods and today pose hard-to-cross physical barriers to pedestrians and cyclists [3, 23]. Onto this network of urban highways within the 50 largest metropolitan areas in the US, we overlay a massive geolocated social network of ties between individuals who follow each other on Twitter [24]. We compute a Barrier Score which quantifies the reduction in the number of social ties crossing highways, comparing the empirical crossings with a null model that makes ties oblivious to highways. The distribution of Barrier Scores reveals that in all 50 cities, the presence of highways consistently correlates with reduced social connectivity compared to the null model, showing that urban highways are barriers to social ties. This reduction is stronger between people living closer to each other, peaking at distances below 5km in most cities and fading beyond 20km. Notoriously, urban highways in the US have been instrumentalized for government-backed racial segregation, creating social divides between communities that persist to this day [8, 25]. We therefore revisit several highways in US cities that are well-documented for their historic role in racial segregation, finding potential evidence for long-lasting effects several decades after their construction, by measuring high Barrier Scores in contemporary social networks.","Luca Maria Aiello, Anastassia Vybornova, Sandor Juhasz, Michael Szell, Eszter Bokanyi",Hemeryck,Mobility & Urban Science II,6,,118

These insights underscore the importance of examining mobility complexity beyond entropy-based measures and adopting a gender-aware approach to mobility analysis.","Silvia De Sojo, Sune Lehmann, Laura Maria Alessandretti",Concert hall,Mobility & Urban Science III,1,,525

Traditional agent-based models often rely on simplified assumptions that fail to account for how diverse populations make decisions under stress. Recently, LLM agent-based modeling has enabled the simulation of human-like decision-making processes, allowing for more realistic and dynamic scenarios. Using large-scale mobile phone GPS location data collected during the 2021 Colorado wildfire from 6,872 individuals, we analyzed personal mobility patterns to define agent characteristics. Each agent was assigned a persona generated by prompts to a large language model (LLM), integrating daily mobility patterns, activity frequencies, and residential attributes. We conducted evacuation simulations under two scenarios: one without social connections and another incorporating social networks derived from co-location data using the Louvain algorithm. Results show that including social connections better replicates actual evacuation patterns, with more gradual and sustained evacuation trends compared to abrupt increases in the model without social influence. Logistic regression analyses confirm that proximity to the fire, sociodemographic characteristics, mobility patterns, and social connections significantly affect evacuation decisions. These findings highlight the crucial role of social networks in capturing real-world evacuation behaviors.","DongHak Lee, Jiayi Weng, Vaidehi Raipat, Takahiro Yabe",Concert hall,Mobility & Urban Science III,2,,301
2025-07-23 11:00:00,2025-07-23 12:30:00,session_presentation,Behavioral response to mobile phone evacuation alerts,"On the night of February 2-3, 2024, severe wildfires ravaged Valparaíso, Chile, marking the country's worst natural disaster since the 2010 earthquakes and the most devastating wildfire in 30 years, with 137 fatalities and over 16,000 people directly affected. While the emergency impacted many people in the region, its effects were expected to burden unequally different socio-demographic groups. This paper examines the stratified re-location behavior of individuals during the wildfire and its differential impacts based on socioeconomic status. SMS-based alerts during emergencies are a highly effective communication tool due to their broad reach, low cost, and immediacy. However, overly broad alerts can lead to over-evacuation, straining infrastructure, and eroding public trust. In this study, we analyzed the immediate and short/medium-term response (days/weeks) to the fires and SMS-based alerts issued during Chile's wildfire event, using spatio-temporal data from a national mobile network and census-based proxies for socioeconomic status (SES). Official alerts provided the timing and location of evacuation messages and affected locations. To understand the causal effects of the Valparaiso wildfires on the populations of interest, we employ difference-in-differences and regression discontinuity methods. The difference-in-differences approach compares changes in outcomes over time between affected and unaffected groups, while regression discontinuity exploits a threshold-based assignment to estimate local treatment effects around the cutoff, the fire in our case. We categorized telecommunication towers into lower, middle, and higher SES groups. We infer the socioeconomic status of antennas based on the educational indicator distributions obtained by the national census for the areas nearby the tower. Based on the associated socioeconomic indicator values, we split towers into three equally populated quantile groups representing the lower, middle, and higher socioeconomic strata. Additionally, we leverage XDR locational data to infer the home towers for each unique phone ID in the Valparaíso region based on the location of the most frequent overnight stay phone tower before the wildfire. Combining this information with the subsequent mobility pattern, we split the population into three groups: potentially affected, likely evacuated, and not affected people. Regarding the immediate response, our findings show that the first SMS alert prompted significant evacuation behavior across all SES groups, regardless of proximity to the wildfire (Figure 1a). Higher SES areas exhibited fewer connections (Figure 1b), suggesting greater capacity for proactive evacuation. Interrupted time-series analysis confirmed that the initial alert was the primary driver of evacuation, with higher SES evacuations influenced more by prudence than direct alert targeting (Figure 1c). Later messages had a diminished effect even for newly warned areas. In the longer term, our analyses show that the wildfire had a statistically significant effect on people spending several nights away from their homes, which hints at the suitability of the dataset to characterize the impacts of these types of fast but short-lived wildfires. Interestingly, we found that the re-location effect is stronger for the low socioeconomic group, who also end up spending more time away from their home towers, with some of them also needing more time to evacuate (Figure 2). We also measured that the affected people reduced their night-to-night travel distances after the wildfires began. In this case, however, no statistically significant differences were observed between the socioeconomic groups. To assess where people went after evacuation, we implemented a spatially informed socioeconomic assortativity analysis of segregation, which shows the mixing patterns in mobility of different socioeconomic groups. High levels of assortativity mean that people tend to travel more to places of the same socioeconomic level. We find a significant decrease in traveling assortativity immediately after the beginning of wildfires, with a subsequent significant increase lasting for 5 nights. This may suggest that people first moved to places like shelters or temporary camps but then relocated to places with more similar socioeconomic profiles than their own, leading to a temporary increase in assortativity (see Figure 3a). A similar conclusion can be drawn from the regression discontinuity and difference-in-differences analysis (see Figure 3b and c, respectively). Our findings show several interesting patterns; initial alerts elicit stronger responses, repeated alerts risk desensitization, and SES shapes evacuation patterns, with higher SES groups better positioned to act. These insights inform strategies to enhance emergency communication, ensuring precision and improved safety for all communities.","Timur Naushirvanov, Erick Elejalde, Kyriaki Kalimeri, Elisa Omodei, Marton Karsai, Leo Ferres",Concert hall,Mobility & Urban Science III,3,,711

Using large-scale mobility data, it is now possible to observe and analyze post-disaster mobility dynamics across a longer time period, compared to household surveys which are often limited in scale. However, much of the mobility data-driven research on evacuation and displacement destination choice behavior has focused on analyzing the effects of physical and spatial factors, often underemphasizing the role of social factors, including individual preferences and social connections. Motivated by the recent literature showing strong associations between social homophily and mobility behavior, we use large-scale data of anonymized GPS traces and online social connections from the Marshall Fires in Colorado, USA, to unravel the associations between social and behavioral factors and evacuation destinations and long-term displacement decisions. We find that behavioral characteristics and social homophily play a significant role in post-disaster mobility decisions. First, incorporating pre-disaster behavior characteristics increases the predictability of evacuated distance by more than five-fold, which is critical for wildfire evacuation. Second, given the same evacuation distance, evacuees chose locations that have a high sociodemographic homophily with their home locations, and locations that have more friendship connections, compared to the level of homophily they are spatially exposed to. The social homophily effect is stronger among White and educated populations than low-income, Black, and Asian populations. This effect has significant implications for long-term disaster impacts and policymaking, as it is a significant predictor of displacement and return decisions. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating the social, behavioral, and economic characteristics to better understand and predict evacuation and displacement dynamics after disasters.","Vaidehi Raipat, Takahiro Yabe",Concert hall,Mobility & Urban Science III,4,,155

Traditional methods like surveys are limited by high cost, required time, and scalability issues. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), specifically Llava 1.6 7B, as a novel approach to assess safety perceptions of urban spaces using street-view images. In addition, the research investigated how this task is affected by different socio-demographic perspectives, simulated by the model through Persona-based prompts. Without additional fine-tuning, the model achieved an average F1-score of 59.21% in classifying urban scenarios as safe or unsafe, identifying three key drivers of perceived unsafety: isolation, physical decay, and urban infrastructural challenges. Moreover, incorporating Persona-based prompts revealed significant variations in safety perceptions across the socio-demographic groups of age, gender, and nationality. Elder and female Personas consistently perceive higher levels of unsafety than younger or male Personas. Similarly, nationality-specific differences were evident in the proportion of unsafe classifications ranging from 19.71% in Singapore to 40.15% in Botswana. Notably, the model’s default configuration aligned most closely with a middle-aged, male Persona. These findings highlight the potential of LMMs as a scalable and cost-effective alternative to traditional methods for urban safety perceptions. While the sensitivity of these models to socio-demographic factors underscores the need for thoughtful deployment, their ability to provide nuanced perspectives makes them a promising tool for AI-driven urban planning.","Ciro Beneduce, Massimiliano Luca, Bruno Lepri",Concert hall,Mobility & Urban Science III,5,,686

More complex causes might be at play, embodied in the networked structure of scientific collaborations. Here, we aim to understand the structural inequality between women and men in the dissemination of scientific knowledge. We use a large-scale dataset of academic publications from the American Physical Society (APS) to build a time-varying network of collaborations from 1970 to 2020. We model knowledge dissemination as a simple contagion process in which scientists become informed based on the propagation of knowledge through their collaborators. We quantify the fairness of the system in terms of how women acquire and diffuse knowledge compared to men. Our results indicate that knowledge acquisition and diffusion are slower for women than expected. We find that the main determinant of women's disadvantage is the gap in the cumulative number of collaborators, highlighting how time creates structural disadvantages that contribute to marginalizing women in physics. Our work sheds light on how the dynamics of scientific collaborations shape gender disparities in knowledge dissemination and calls for a deeper understanding of how to intervene to improve fairness and diversity in the scientific community.","Chiara Zappalà, Luca Gallo, Jan Bachmann, Federico Battiston, Fariba Karimi",Concert hall,Science of Science I,1,,769

Our findings reveal that men dominate authorship, citation impact, and prestigious awards, with women receiving fewer citations and lower financial compensation.

Parenthood is a key factor contributing to gender disparities, yet the specific role of childcare responsibilities remains understudied (Derrick et al., 2021). Moreover, it is essential to consider the evolving beliefs about gender roles and the uncertain influence of institutional parental support. Recent studies indicate a shift toward more egalitarian gender role beliefs among both men and women (Bleske-Rechek & Gunseor, 2022). Women are increasingly rejecting gender norms, while men are becoming more involved in family and child-rearing responsibilities. Are academics’ gender role beliefs evolving, and could these changes lead to a different distribution of caregiving responsibilities across genders? Besides, while institutional support is intended to mitigate these challenges, its effectiveness is uncertain, with some policies potentially reinforcing disparities. This study examines the interplay between gender, childcare responsibilities, gender role beliefs, and institutional support to better understand their impact on scientists’ careers. Specifically, we seek to address the following research questions: (1) How do childcare responsibilities help explain the gender gap in academic achievements as a mediator? (2) Do academics’ egalitarian gender role beliefs moderate the associations between gender and childcare responsibilities? (3) Can institutional parenting support policies moderate the association between childcare responsibilities and academics’ career outcomes? Our research leverages a large-scale survey data and bibliographic records from Clarivate’s Web of Science. Researchers affiliated with US and Canadian institutions were surveyed via Qualtrics between June and July 2019. From an initial pool of 396,674 scholars, a random sample of 99,168 was invited to participate, with 9,105 completing the survey. After refining the dataset to include only respondents with at least one child, the final analytical sample comprised 5,670 scholars (44.56% men, 55.44% women). This study employs several statistical analysis techniques, including Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and moderated linear regressions. This research sheds light on the persistent gender disparities in academia, particularly in the division of childcare responsibilities and the impact of gender role beliefs and institutional support policies. The main theoretical contribution is as follows: 1. It reveals a misalignment between evolving gender role beliefs and the actual distribution of childcare responsibilities in academia. While both men and women increasingly endorse egalitarian beliefs, women continue to bear a disproportionate caregiving burden. This imbalance persists due to societal and workplace norms that reinforce traditional gender roles, limiting men’s involvement in parenting. However, the research highlights that as women’s egalitarian beliefs strengthen, their childcare responsibilities decrease—an effect not observed in men. This finding aligns with theories of maternal gatekeeping, suggesting that women’s beliefs play a crucial role in reshaping caregiving dynamics. The study underscores the need for policy reforms and cultural shifts to promote a more equitable balance between professional and family responsibilities in academia. 2. This study confirms that childcare responsibilities significantly mediate gender disparities in academic career achievements, impacting both objective and subjective outcomes. Women academics bear more childcare responsibilities, with the effect being particularly pronounced among those with an employed partner or those with partners in non-research-related jobs. While prior research has examined parenthood's impact on gender disparities, childcare as a distinct factor has been understudied. This study unravels the heightened stress women face in balancing professional and caregiving responsibilities, emphasizing the need for institutional support and cultural change. By identifying particularly vulnerable groups, the findings offer critical insights for policies aimed at fostering greater gender equity in academia. 3. This study highlights the complex impact of institutional parental support policies on gender disparities in academia. While flexible work schedules and childcare support help mitigate the adverse effects of caregiving on women’s careers, policies such as paused tenure clocks and paternity leave may unintentionally reinforce gender inequalities. To contextualize these findings, it is essential to consider that the ""parenting penalty"" is closely tied to the level of engagement in caregiving activities and the ways in which institutions enforce parental support policies.","Xi Hong, Xiang Zheng, Chaoqun Ni",Concert hall,Science of Science I,3,,677

Because such studies struggle to account for confounding factors like research quality, the underlying causes of the gender gap in scholarly recognition, as measured through citations, remain unclear. As citation-based metrics are increasingly used to evaluate scientists, calibrate recommendation systems, and allocate funding, understanding whether these disparities stem from gender bias is essential. Here, we address this knowledge gap with a randomized experiment surveying 169,765 researchers. In this experiment, participants evaluated abstracts generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) tailored to their field, attributed to either a fictional male or female author. The reported likelihood of citing research measures the Matilda effect, a recognition bias against female scientists. This procedure addresses two key limitations of prior studies: It is large-scale and it controls for quality. Surprisingly, our results reveal no significant gender difference in citation likelihood or reported credibility of the abstracts. These findings challenge prevailing hypotheses, underscoring the complexity of factors influencing gender disparities in science and calling for more large-scale controlled experiments in science. Our insights hold important implications for identifying the correct drivers of gender disparities documented in the literature, for improving evaluation practices, and for refining policies to address gender disparities in scientific recognition.","Sandro Ferreira Sousa, Roberta Sinatra, James Evans, Luca Maria Aiello, Zhilong Chen",Concert hall,Science of Science I,4,,683

While structural inequities in peer review have been widely debated, far less attention has been paid to the subtle ways in which language itself may reinforce disparities. This study undertakes one of the most comprehensive linguistic analyses of peer review to date, examining over 80,000 reviews across two major journals. Using natural language processing and large-scale statistical modeling, it uncovers how review tone, sentiment, and supportive language vary across author demographics—including gender, race, and institutional affiliation. By leveraging a dataset that includes both anonymous and signed reviews, this research also reveals how reviewer identity disclosure shapes the language of evaluation. The findings not only expose hidden biases in peer feedback but also challenge conventional assumptions about anonymity’s role in fairness.

In a novel contribution, we use a comprehensive dataset and a citation network approach to demonstrate that African and Africa-based scholars are even more underrepresented in the most influential research. Drawing on articles published from 1956 onward in the top 20 political science journals with “Africa” or an African country in their title, we computed the PageRank centrality of more than 16,000 nodes in the network to identify the most influential papers. We then disaggregated our analysis by author nationality, location, and gender, uncovering stark underrepresentation of African, Africa-based, and female scholars. Furthermore, we employ regression modeling to show robust negative associations between the share of African and women authors and an article’s PageRank centrality. These findings offer stronger quantitative evidence of the marginalization of African researchers in shaping the dominant academic scholarship on African politics.","Zack Zimbalist, Elisa Omodei",Concert hall,Science of Science I,6,,264

This study examines how interdisciplinarity during doctoral training influences faculty placement at top universities across diverse fields. Analyzing the career trajectories of 32,977 faculty members from 355 U.S. universities, we find that PhD graduates with higher interdisciplinarity are less likely to secure faculty positions at top-ranked institutions, particularly when remaining in their doctoral discipline. Instead, top universities tend to favor candidates with lower PhD interdisciplinarity, aligning with established research priorities. This preference disproportionately affects women, who exhibit higher interdisciplinarity on average. Furthermore, we show that faculty with greater interdisciplinarity achieve higher long-term research productivity, suggesting a potential loss in innovation when top institutions undervalue interdisciplinary scholars. These findings highlight structural barriers in faculty hiring and raise concerns about the long-term consequences of prioritizing disciplinary specialization over interdisciplinary expertise.","Xiang Zheng, Anli Peng, Xi Hong, Chaoqun Ni",Concert hall,Science of Science II,1,,656

Effective science communication relies on accurately conveying research findings, yet many social science articles use Narrative License (NL)—claims that overstate, misrepresent, or distort results. This study examines the prevalence of inappropriate causal language in cross-sectional studies, which inherently cannot establish causality due to their lack of temporal order, randomization, or experimental controls. Using a dataset of 8,258 cross-sectional articles from PsycINFO, we applied a Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted classification to assess the prevalences of causal claims. Manual verification confirmed high accuracy, and results revealed that 59% of abstracts contained some form of causal language, with direct and implied causal statements increasing over time. Articles using causal language were slightly more likely to appear in lower-impact journals and had fewer citations, but these differences were very small, reflecting statistical more than substantive differences. Similar findings emerge for different disciplines, where some fields had slightly higher and lower prevalence rates, all fields had a similarly high amount of inappropriate claims. These findings suggest that while methodological reforms have improved research rigor, rhetorical overstatement remains prevalent. We propose that LLMs can assist in detecting and mitigating NL, supporting both authors in refining claims and readers in critically assessing research. This study highlights the need for greater attention to linguistic precision in scientific writing.","Calvin Isch, Timothy Dörr, Neil Fasching",Concert hall,Science of Science II,4,,61

A Large-Scale Randomized Field Experiment,"The transformative impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various sectors has demonstrated their potential to enhance productivity and facilitate complex decision-making processes, significantly altering innovation workflows. Despite their widespread adoption in commercial and consumer domains, the integration of LLMs into the unique processes of scientific discovery and innovation has been minimally explored. In the process of scientific discovery, feedback and revision are critical components of knowledge production, essential for refining and validating new scientific insights. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of existing feedback channels is currently under significant strain. On one hand, there is a critical shortage of high-quality feedback, which poses a substantial barrier to the sustained development of the scientific field. For instance, the traditional peer review system, a primary avenue for such feedback, is burdened by rapidly increasing submission volumes, escalating costs in terms of labor and resources, and the complexity of increasingly specialized tasks. On the other hand, the global academic research ecosystem is riddled with deep-seated inequities. Feedback channels within elite institutions in Western countries often exclude diverse geographical perspectives, perpetuating existing barriers and reinforcing systemic inequities within the scientific community. Against this backdrop, the question arises: Can LLMs help overcome these challenges by providing scalable and efficient feedback? Preliminary studies have suggested that LLMs can produce coherent and contextually relevant feedback that could supplement human reviews. In one of our foundational studies, we systematically compared feedback generated by LLMs with that provided by reviewers from top-tier journals and conferences. The results revealed a high degree of alignment between the two sources of feedback, and our follow-up use study revealed 82.4% of participants in the user study preferring the LLM-generated feedback over that from some human reviewers . Despite these promising results, there remains a significant gap in causal evidence regarding the real impact of LLMs in the context of scientific feedback, particularly concerning their utility, accuracy, and acceptance within the academic community. To address these gaps, we conducted a large-scale randomized field experiment to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-generated feedback on scientific papers. This experiment involves 34,340 recent arXiv preprints in 2024 by 50,454 scholars across 8 STEM domains and 136 regions globally (Figure 1). From these preprints, we extracted metadata including author, email, institution, and field of study. We then implemented a stratified random selection across 150 subfields to create a representative and balanced sample for our interventions. To enhance the precision of the feedback provided, we refined the prompts of our LLM by incorporating multi-agent systems that perform review analysis, title suggestions, and grammar checks. These were combined with in-context learning techniques to uniquely tailor the feedback for each individual preprint. Each participant in the treatment group accessed their feedback through a private link sent in targeted emails, personalizing the interaction and enabling detailed tracking of their engagement with the feedback, subsequent revision activities, and overall responses. Considering the logistical challenges in generating and distributing feedback on a large scale, with delays ranging from 1-5 months from initial arXiv submission, we excluded papers that were published or revised prior to our feedback dispatch. To quantify the effects of treatment on their likelihood of revision within one month, we employed logistic regression analysis. As illustrated in Figure 2, there was a notable increase of 11.7% in the likelihood of revisions among the treatment group within one month. Also, there was a marked difference in revision likelihood between non-English and English-speaking teams. Non-English speaking teams who received feedback were 19.4% more likely to revise their papers within a month, a statistically significant difference. In contrast, there was no significant effect observed among English-speaking teams. Our qualitative analysis on text corroborated these quantitative results, revealing that scholars from non-English speaking country or lower-prestige institutions perceived the feedback as more constructive and valuable compared to their counterparts from English-speaking countries or higher-prestige institutions. This disparity suggests that the benefits of using LLMs for scientific feedback are particularly significant for scholars from marginalized groups and those in resource-scarce environments, thus making scientific discourse more accessible to a wider and more diverse audience.","Binglu Wang, Weixin Liang, Jiahui Xue, Yuhui Zhang, Hancheng Cao, Dashun Wang, Yian Yin",Concert hall,Science of Science II,5,,1004

We use LLMs to generate synthetic samples of responses to behavioural studies and estimate whether the measured effects support the original findings. When compared with human replication results for these studies, we achieve F1 values of up to $77\%$ with Mistral 7B, $67\%$ with GPT-4o and Llama 3 8B, and $55\%$ with Qwen 2 7B, suggesting their potential for this task.

Past research shows that co-authorship networks influence professional trajectories and facilitate breakthrough discoveries. At the same time, researchers often rely on other, more informal types of collaboration and exchange. These informal ties give shape to structures of support that are often referred to as the `invisible college'. In these networks, communication is not based on publications (via co-authorship or citations) but rather on more intangible exchanges that nonetheless also feed relevant information (e.g., guidance, feedback) into the exercise of scientific research. Here we aim to grant some visibility to this intangible structure by retrieving the `thank you' notes from the acknowledgment sections of published papers. To assess on whether the structural diversity leads to higher diversity in terms of topic domains, we combine these topological measures with structural topic modeling and analyze a corpus of 129,750 papers published in Political Science journals from 2003 to 2024 authored by 85,653 different authors. Our analyses reveal two things: (1) scientists have higher levels of structural diversity (topologically defined) in their acknowledgment networks, compared to the co-authorship counterpart; and (2) structural diversity is positively associated with topic diversity in both networks, but especially so in informal collaborations. Acknowledgment ties, in other words, create more versatile networks. These findings suggest that embeddedness in informal structures of communication is, potentially, an important source of variation in career trajectories and indicators of success that should, therefore, receive more empirical attention.","Lluis Danus, Guy Grossman, catba, wdinneen, Sandra Gonzalez-Bailon",Vingen 3+4,Science of Science III,1,,380

This work bridges bibliometric and health data to reveal a persistent misalignment between global research priorities and actual disease burden. By integrating clinical publication data with standardized health metrics, we demonstrate that diseases prevalent in high-income settings receive disproportionate attention, whereas conditions affecting low-income regions remain markedly under-studied. We observed doubling in research responsiveness over three decades which highlights a shifting yet still imbalanced agenda, with clear implications for reorienting funding, policy, and local research capacity toward a more needs-driven global health strategy. Theoretical contribution. Our study refines theories in global health equity \cite{ostlin2005priorities} and the science of science by integrating bibliometric mapping with public health metrics. Building on prior work on research misalignment, we introduce a novel measurement framework that distinguishes between research production and contextual evidence sourcing. By linking clinical publications to health measures through text embeddings and standardized disease codes, our approach quantifies “research responsiveness” and reveals how socioeconomic factors and market-driven incentives bias both public and private research agendas toward diseases prevalent in high-income settings. Data and Methods. This study analyzes 308,135 clinical medicine research articles sourced from OpenAlex. For each paper, we use large language models to extract structured information from titles and abstracts—including evidence source countries, relevant diseases, and key medical concepts—which are then mapped to Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) using neural text embeddings. These MeSH codes are subsequently linked to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) through the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and further connected to corresponding disease burdens as quantified by Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in the Global Disease Burden dataset. The resulting dataset covers 20 general disease burdens, capturing both research volumes and associated DALYs for various countries from 1990 to 2021. We begin with descriptive analyses to examine the distribution and evenness of disease research across countries at different development levels over time. To further explore the alignment between research output and health needs, we employ fixed-effects regressions structured around three research questions: (1) Which disease burdens receive disproportionate research attention relative to its health impact; (2) How responsive is a country's research output to its pressing disease burden; and (3) How has this responsiveness evolved over time. Findings. Global disease research exhibits a prominent segregation between research production and evidence sourcing. Lower-income countries contribute less than 1\% of authorship across all disease categories, yet they account for a disproportionate share of study context, especially for neglected tropical diseases, malaria, and HIV/AIDS, which illustrates a significant gap in local research participation. Promisingly, our analyses show increasing diversity in country engagement in both research production and evidence sourcing over time, indicating a broader, more inclusive global participation. Connecting disease research with disease burden statistics, our fixed-effects regressions reveal several key insights. First, after controlling for country- and disease-specific factors, research attention is disproportionately concentrated on neoplasms, cardiovascular diseases, and certain infectious diseases, while conditions such as respiratory infections, tuberculosis, skin and subcutaneous diseases, and nutritional deficiencies receive relatively less attention compared to their health impact. Second, countries with higher GDP per capita tend to align their research output more closely with their pressing health challenges, although considerable heterogeneity exists even among the wealthiest nations. Finally, over the past 30 years, the responsiveness of research output to disease burden has doubled, suggesting that research efforts are progressively more attuned to critical public health needs.","Prashant Garg, Hongyu Zhou, Thiemo Fetzer",Vingen 3+4,Science of Science III,3,,820

Less is known, however, how school-boundary-transient STEM-oriented latent communities may be embedded in course-taking given the national math/science curriculum for secondary education. Individual choices of course-taking, STEM interest nurtured by the family and school, and tracking structures of school organizations jointly give rise to a national landscape of math/science course-taking that embeds STEM-oriented latent communities of unobserved STEM readiness and interest. These communities may exert a long-lasting effect beyond high school into postsecondary education and the labor market. In this study, using a nationally representative sample of high school students, we detected STEM-oriented latent communities from the network of students who took math and science courses of a nationally representative sample of high school students and examined the influence of such latent communities on college STEM pursuit.

On the relevance of time in higher education investments,"This paper focuses on implications of time in higher education investments in Sweden. Prior research shed light on social and educational differences across institutions and fields of study, but less attention has been paid on how temporal dimensions –timing, sequencing and duration– produce differences in trajectories engaging at any point in the system. The aim is to understand the simultaneous unfolding of educationally- and occupationally-related trajectories by the identification of temporal patterns in which higher education is embedded in life courses. Using administrative data from Statistics Sweden, individual sequences in four domains were constructed for those leaving compulsory school in 2000 and enrolling tertiary education up to 2019: educational status, educational level, occupational status and income group. Multidomain sequence analysis was applied for quantifying pairwise distances and, after clustering, produce a typology of temporalities representing varied modalities of investment and accumulation at post-secondary level, and conversion of these assets into occupational and rewards structures. Findings show that trajectories mostly differ in timing of arrival and duration of permanence in higher education, but also in how this is paralleled –or not– with commitments in other spheres that might impact on such temporal dimensions. Furthermore, results suggest that degree completion leads to occupational and income upgrading according to the length of investment. In sum, earliness and lengthening in higher education seem to further the advantage into subsequent social arenas by reaching high-status and income occupations; contrary to belatedness and shortening that undermine the value of the investment and, in turn, restricts its conversion into less profitable positions.",Ricardo Cevallos,Vingen 8,Education,2,,381

This paper studies teacher-directed scientific change for one of the largest changes in the direction of research, the Scientific Revolution. Specifically, the paper considers the case of the English Scientific Revolution at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. It argues that exposure to different teachers shaped students' direction of research and can partly account for the successful trajectory of English science. For this, the paper introduces a novel dataset on the universe of all 111,242 students at English universities in the seventeenth and early eighteenth century and matches them to their publications. Using machine learning, the paper is able to quantify personal interest in different research topics. To derive causal estimates of teacher-student effects, the paper uses an instrumental variable design that predicts students’ choice of college based on their home regions, a stacked differences-in-differences approach exploiting teachers leaving their college, and a natural experiment based on the expulsion of teachers following the English Civil War. The paper finds empirical evidence of teacher-directed change in the English Scientific Revolution. These results illustrate how teacher-directed change can contribute to paradigm change.

Yet, recent quantitative work on collective memory often relies on indicators of online attention that do not distinguish between local and global forms of popularity. Here, we introduce a method to separate local and global collective memory starting from the online attention received by 50,000+ biographies across 300+ different language editions of Wikipedia and validate it using data from an online trivia game where 40,000+ players from around the world answered questions about local and foreign historical figures. We show that players were more likely to answer correctly questions about figures that were local to them and with higher scores in our globality measure. Finally, we explore how major life events, such as receiving a major award (Oscar or Nobel Prize) and death shape the dynamics of local and global attention. We find the impact of these events to be different. Awards and death are followed by large but short-lived spikes in local attention and milder but longer-lived increases in global attention. These findings advance our understanding of collective memory by unpacking local and global forms of remembrance.","Mariana Macedo, Melanie Oyarzun, Cristian E Candia, Cesar A Hidalgo",Vingen 8,Wikipedia,2,,817

Its perceived neutrality and accuracy make it an influential resource for voters, researchers, and machine learning applications (Neuberger, 2014; Messner & South, 2011). Platforms like Google use Wikipedia content for knowledge boxes and verification tags, while political scientists and AI developers rely on it for datasets (Göbel & Munzert, 2018; Salem & Stephany, 2023). Given this central role, Wikipedia’s coverage of political figures can have real effects, influencing public perception and even electoral outcomes, particularly for lesser-known candidates (Haman et al., 2021). However, Wikipedia’s open editing model raises concerns about strategic modifications to political articles, especially before elections. Prior studies have documented cases of political staffers editing pages to present candidates favorably (Agarwal et al., 2020), yet the timing, scale, and nature of these edits—especially across different language editions—remain underexplored. This study examines Wikipedia edits to U.S. politicians’ pages in the English and Spanish editions to assess whether strategic changes occur in the lead-up to elections. To do so, it compiles a large-scale dataset of Wikipedia revisions, election timelines, and congressional demographics. The dataset includes: 94,918 revisions to U.S. legislators' Wikipedia pages (English and Spanish) since 2002, with timestamps, editor metadata, and edit summaries. 21,445 full article snapshots from two weeks before major U.S. elections across 10 election cycles. 2,672,537 daily traffic observations from English and Spanish Wikipedia. Supplementary data on congressional districts (U.S. Census) and election results (MIT Election Data and Science Lab, 2017). The analysis proceeds in three steps: (1) classifying edits and editors, (2) examining temporal patterns, and (3) assessing political correlates. First, edits are categorized using a pre-existing classifier (Yang, Halfaker, Kraut, & Hovy, 2018) that distinguishes between 14 types of changes (e.g., counter-vandalism, point-of-view edits). To assess and improve its accuracy, newer-generation models (transformers, large language models) will be trained using this classifier’s dataset alongside newly annotated examples, particularly to enhance performance beyond the English-language context. Editors are identified through heuristic classification (edit speed, metadata patterns, bot flags/names), ORES bot scores, and network analysis to detect coordinated or polarized editing. Anonymous users’ IP addresses are analyzed for geographic patterns, given that 20% of edits are often made anonymously, some of which have been linked to political actors (Agarwal et al., 2020). Next, time series models explore whether editing spikes before elections and whether content changes align with shifts in public interest, inferred from daily page traffic data. This analysis helps determine whether Wikipedia is actively shaped by political events, scandals, or campaign strategies. Finally, the study investigates whether factors like race competitiveness and constituency demographics influence editing patterns. By integrating election results and census data, it assesses whether strategic editing varies by political context (e.g., volume of edits, types of editors). The findings will provide insight into Wikipedia’s role in shaping political narratives and election-related information. Given its impact on AI training data, search results, and misinformation detection, understanding strategic editing is critical for maintaining the integrity of political information online. This study contributes to broader discussions on digital governance, platform accountability, and the political manipulation of knowledge platforms.",Felicia Loecherbach,Vingen 8,Wikipedia,3,,736

Our study aims to understand how coordination costs evolve as projects grow, focusing on the interplay between interactive (personal) and formal (impersonal) coordination. This research is motivated by longstanding theories, including Weber’s observations on the emergence of bureaucratic organization in maturing systems. Using a scaling framework, we quantify coordination costs with power-law relationships between the number of unique contributors and various measures of coordination effort, such as talk-page discussion length, revert frequency, administrator edits, and bot interventions. Our analysis of over 26,000 projects reveals that interactive activities scale superlinearly with contributor count, while formal actions show sublinear scaling, reflecting an economy of scale in administrative and rule-enforcing functions. Employing principal component analysis, we identify two key dimensions—termed the “controversy” and “compensation” axes—that capture distinct aspects of coordination. The controversy axis aggregates measures of personal interactions, such as discussions and conflicts, whereas the compensation axis highlights the role of formal, impersonal coordination mechanisms. These findings indicate that as projects mature, there is a natural emergence of impersonal coordination, a transition that echoes Weber’s theoretical perspective on the evolution from personalized collaboration to bureaucratic organization. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the dynamics of coordination in collective intelligence systems. By elucidating the scaling laws and dual-dimensional structure of coordination costs, we offer new insights into how self-organized communities can balance the increasing demands of collaboration with the efficiencies of formalized control, thereby advancing our understanding of both digital and traditional organizational systems.","Jisung Yoon, Vicky Chuqiao Yang, Chris Kempes, Seoul Lee, gbw, Hyejin Youn",Vingen 8,Wikipedia,6,,728

2025-07-23 11:00:00,2025-07-23 12:30:00,session_presentation,Modelling Norm Networks: Understanding Network Adaptation To New Norms,"Motivation and Background: Research suggests that changing social norms can help catalyze broader social transformations, particularly in response to pressing challenges like the climate and ecological crises [1]. Norms guide behavior across multiple arenas—such as determining which policies are viable or where capital can be invested—and often underpin the legal frameworks that regulate societies. Crucially, norms differ from beliefs, opinions, or values because their violation typically incurs sanctions, thereby reinforcing collective adherence [2]. While research indicates that new norms (e.g., anti–fossil fuel norms [3]) can diffuse through social networks via complex contagion processes [4], existing models frequently oversimplify these dynamics and overlook the intricate interplay among multiple, interacting norms. In reality, societies are shaped by an extensive web of norms that vary in salience, reinforce one another, or even conflict. Clusters of similar norms can emerge, and hierarchical structures often develop, with overarching principles (e.g., “do not harm others”) governing subordinate ones. Recent empirical work on norm networks [5] further suggests that the interconnectedness and relational patterns among norms significantly influence whether and how new norms gain traction. For instance, a nascent norm that aligns well with influential, established norms and is free of major conflicts may spread more readily than one that contradicts entrenched normative frameworks. Research goal and theme: Our research aims to understand how the structure of norm networks and the attributes of their connections (e.g., edge weights) affect the network’s ability to incorporate new norm nodes. We model the norm network as a signed network and study the resulting structural balance after the addition of a new node. The literature on structural balance in signed networks spans theoretical frameworks and computational analyses, with a focus on the interplay between local interactions and global network dynamics [6-8]. By exploring the structural barriers that impede the local integration of new norms within an existing interconnected network, our study seeks to contribute to both the literature on norm dynamics and the broader field of network analysis. In the second stage (ongoing and future work), we plan to investigate how the internal dynamics of norms interact with the structural characteristics of social networks. This research will explore the pathways through which new norms diffuse and how these processes ultimately contribute to meaningful social change. Similar to [9], we aim to analyze norm network dynamics at both the individual and collective levels, thereby enriching our understanding of the mechanisms that drive normative evolution. Results: Following the node addition, we examined the relationship between the network's structural properties (e.g., degree, centrality, and clustering), the distribution of edge signs, and the overall structural balance. Our preliminary results suggest that while metrics such as node degree and eigenvector centrality have varied influences on changes in dissonance, the proportion of unbalanced cycles associated with the edge forming a triad with the new node is a strong predictor of the overall change in balance. For instance, Fig.1 illustrates that the node degree and eigenvector centrality of the target node pairs (to which a new node is added) do not show a clear relationship with post-addition network balance. In contrast, a high proportion of unbalanced cycles involving the targeted edge correlates with a noticeable decrease in balance. Specifically, when a new node is added to an edge where more than 40\% of the cycles are unbalanced, the network's balance decreases significantly. These findings provide early evidence that successfully integrating new norm nodes without increasing overall network dissonance critically depends on the existing balance characteristics.","Ajaykumar Manivannan, Viktoria Spaiser",Troselli,Network Science,1,,611
2025-07-23 11:00:00,2025-07-23 12:30:00,session_presentation,Impact frequency shuffling on synchronization in a ring network,"Synchronization is a universal phenomenon observed in various real-world systems including power grids, neural networks, and coupled oscillators [1,2,3]. It has been considered as one of important research topics in nonlinear dynamics because the synchronous state ensures stable and efficient operation of a system. Previous research has shown that applying frequency shuffling, in which oscillators exchange their natural frequencies over time, can facilitate synchronization and reduce the time required to achieve it [4]. This study has focused on all-to-all coupled networks. However, since many real-world systems operate under more constrained connectivity such as sparse or irregular interaction, it still leaves the question of how frequency shuffling affects structured oscillator networks with local interactions. In this work, we investigate the influence of frequency shuffling on the synchronization dynamics in a 1D ring structure (Fig. 1). Specifically, we consider a 1D ring network of coupled phase oscillators governed by the first-order Kuramoto model [5] \begin{equation} \frac{d\theta_i}{dt} = \omega_i + \frac{K}{2} \left[ \sin(\theta_{i+1} - \theta_i) + \sin(\theta_{i-1} - \theta_i) \right], \end{equation} where $\theta_i$ represents the phase of the $i$th oscillator, $\omega_i$ is the natural frequency of $i$ and $K$ is the coupling strength. The system follows periodic boundary conditions, ensuring $\theta_{N+1} = \theta_1$ and $\theta_0 = \theta_N$. In this framework, frequency shuffling modifies the temporal evolution of $\omega_i$, effectively altering the interaction dynamics over time. Unlike all-to-all coupled networks, where shuffling consistently improved synchronization, our results demonstrate a nonmonotonic behavior in the order parameter as the shuffling rate increases (Fig. 2). In particular, increasing the shuffling rate $\lambda$ leads to an initial increase in the order parameter, attributed to a reduction in the overall frequency variance (Fig. 3A). However, beyond an optimal value of $\lambda$, the order parameter decreases and the oscillators become phase-locked in twisted states, similar to those observed in identical oscillators on lattice structure [6, 7]. To investigate whether this decrease in the order parameter is due to the stabilization of twisted states, we conduct simulations in which the system is initialized as a twisted state with the winding number $q=1$ and observe the probability that the system remains in that state as $\lambda$ increases. Our results confirm that at low $\lambda$, the system transitions away from the initial twisted state, whereas at higher $\lambda$ the system remains locked in the initial configuration, thereby reducing the overall synchronization level (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, in the large-$\lambda$ limit, the system effectively converges to the case where all oscillators share an identical frequency ($\omega=0$), as demonstrated by the similarity between the shuffled system and the identical-frequency system (Fig. 3C). Our findings reveal that, while moderate frequency shuffling enhances global synchronization, excessive shuffling stabilizes incoherent states suppressing global order when oscillators are coupled through regular structure.","Juseong Kim, Cook Hyun Kim, Jong-Min Park, Heetae Kim",Troselli,Network Science,2,,678

While interactions are usually modeled as pairwise networks, the units of many real-world systems can also interact in groups of three or more. Here, we introduce a general framework to extend pairwise games to higher-order networks. By studying social dilemmas on hypergraphs with a tunable structure, we find an explosive transition to cooperation triggered by a critical number of higher-order games. The associated bistable regime implies that an initial critical mass of cooperators is also required for the emergence of prosocial behavior. Our results show that higher-order interactions provide a novel explanation for the survival of cooperation.","Andrea Civilini, Onkar Sadekar, Federico Battiston, Jesus Gomez-Gardeñes, Vito Latora",Troselli,Network Science,3,,990

We address these gaps by integrating the literature on signed networks and structural balance theory with brokerage theory, focusing on network ties around a dyad featuring a structural hole. We propose that the presence of a common neighbours between the bridged nodes, along with the valence of those ties, may explain the absence of a direct tie. To test this, we conduct descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses using MRQAP models on secondary data from 24 cross-sectional signed networks of varying sizes and contexts. Our meta-analyses provide empirical support for our hypothesis: a dyad surrounded by three positive ties and one negative tie—a configuration we term the 3PN diamond—is associated with a higher likelihood of constituting a structural hole. We discuss the implications of our findings for theory and research, highlighting the potential of our framework to advance the study of brokerage in networks.(For the extended abstract, please see the uploaded pdf document)","Paul Schuler, Srebrenka Letina, Károly Takács",Troselli,Network Science,4,,622

A core theme in diffusion research is the design of interventions that facilitate the large-scale adoption of a target behavioral change. In the diffusion literature, there is general agreement that the structure of social networks significantly affects the adoption of a new product or behaviour, and effective seeds can be identified through their position in the relevant social network. Various studies have proposed seeding central nodes identified through various centrality measures and have shown the structural properties of the underlying social network can alter dramatically the relative effectiveness of different seeding interventions. However, despite the theoretical richness and relevance of the obtained insights, their precise real-world application remains limited. Conducting network interventions in the field requires detailed social network data, whose collection is either resource and time-intensive and, for this reason, it typically cannot be carried out at large scale, or, in some contexts, is accessible to only a handful of organizations. In this study, we develop new techniques to estimate individual and network-level variables relevant for seeding interventions from a small yet strategically selected sample that acts as social sensors, circumventing the need to map in detail the entire social network in a population. We estimate in the field the accuracy of the developed methods and identify the characteristics of people who are accurate in their estimations. Furthermore, we assess the robustness of network interventions based on the proposed techniques to the accuracy of the estimations. This enables both the application of social network interventions to previously inaccessible contexts — i.e., contexts where social network data is inaccessible or severely limited — as well as the development and implementation of new interventions.","Luca Lazzaro, Mingmin Feng, Norina Anna Furrer, Manon Delvaux, Federico Cammelli, Manuel S.

Since the formation of social connections is largely driven by mechanisms of homophily and triadic closure, emergent network communities often reinforce socio-economic homogeneity that can lead to inequalities in local economies. Although communities can facilitate information exchange and peer effects, large-scale evidence regarding the dynamics of economic progress within network communities remains scarce. Here, we show that social network communities within the 50 largest U.S. metropolitan areas support income convergence over time. We use a unique geolocated social network data from Twitter, which contains 982,459 users and 2,711,185 social ties between them as of 2012--2013. By locating the home census tracts of frequently messaging users, we construct weighted social networks at the census tract level within the 50 largest US metropolitan areas from mutual follower relationships. We identify urban network communities with a spatially sensitive Louvain algorithm of Expert et al. (2011), which accounts for nearby nodes being more likely to connect. Yearly household income of tracts and socio-demographic variables are retrieved from the American Community Survey. Using multivariate regression models, our findings reveal that (1) there is sigma convergence within social network communities between 2012 and 2019. Income disparities within these communities are becoming significantly smaller over the period. Moreover, these communities predict income convergence more strongly than conventional administrative units within the metropolitan area (e.g., counties, school districts). (2) Even after controlling for socio-economic factors, we observe beta-convergence, indicating that lower-income tracts within a community tend to catch up economically. Our approach enables us to reveal heterogeneity across US metropolitan areas, across ethnic groups, and to identify the role of residential mixing in the aggregate economic outcome in neighborhoods. These results underscore the importance of local social networks in shaping economic outcomes and suggest that policies aiming to reduce inequalities and foster urban transformation should consider network-based boundaries.","Imre Gémes, Eszter Bokanyi, Sandor Juhasz, Balázs Lengyel, Gergo Toth",Hemeryck,Social Networks I,1,,643

Complex contagion theory serves as a pivotal framework for modeling such diffusion where individuals need reinforcement from multiple social contacts before adopting a new product or behavior and adopt only when a specific fraction of their social contacts (i.e., their threshold) have already adopted it. While existing research debates whether targeting social hubs or early adopters is more effective, the role of homophily—the tendency of individuals to associate with similar others—remains underexplored in complex contagion. In this study, we leverage a recent framework to empirically estimate adoption thresholds using choice experiments in two contexts: political decision-making and social technology adoption. We integrate these real-world threshold distributions into simulations of complex contagion on synthetic networks with varying levels of homophily to systematically compare the performance of seeding strategies. Our results indicate that individual adoption thresholds in reality do not follow a uniform distribution but instead exhibit a bimodal pattern. By integrating empirically estimated individual behavior measures into simulations, we find that the effectiveness of seeding strategies in driving large-scale diffusion may be overestimated if homophily is not accounted for. These findings offer valuable insights into the conditions under which interventions can effectively scale behavioral change, contributing to research in marketing, public policy, and social movement strategies.","Mingmin Feng, Manuel S.

In this study, I argue that religious embeddedness—the degree to which individuals share social ties with other members in the same organization—mitigates this effect through commitment mechanisms. Using longitudinal data for the years 2000 to 2022, with information on Church of Sweden memberships, fees, and network ties for the entire Swedish population, I estimate how membership fees impact disaffiliation likelihood and how religious embeddedness moderates this relationship. My analyses confirm that higher church fees increase disaffiliation probability, but this effect is weaker among individuals with many social ties to other church members. Using these estimates and the observed social network, I calibrate an agent-based simulation model to examine macro-level implications. The simulations reveal that religious embeddedness serves as a protective force against membership decline. However, as disaffiliation progresses and religious network density wanes, this protective buffer gradually erodes, potentially creating tipping points that can accelerate disaffiliation rates dramatically. These findings demonstrate how social networks provide resilience against economic costs while also creating conditions for nonlinear membership decline patterns in membership-based organizations.",Elis Carlberg Larsson,Hemeryck,Social Networks I,5,,872

The existence of a capacity to have and to track antagonistic ties raises the possibility that they may serve a useful function in human groups. Here, we analyze empirical data gathered from 24,770 and 22,513 individuals in 176 rural villages in Honduras in two survey waves 2.5 y apart in order to evaluate the possible relevance of antagonistic relationships for broader network phenomena. We find that the small-world effect is more significant in a positive world with negative ties compared to an otherwise similar hypothetical positive world without them. Additionally, we observe that nodes with more negative ties tend to be located near network bridges, with lower clustering coefficients, higher betweenness centralities, and shorter average distances to other nodes in the network. Positive connections tend to have a more localized distribution, while negative connections are more globally dispersed within the networks. Analysis of the possible impact of such negative ties on dynamic processes reveals that, remarkably, negative connections can facilitate the dissemination of information (including novel information experimentally introduced into these villages) to the same degree as positive connections, and that they can also play a role in mitigating idea polarization within village networks. Antagonistic ties hold considerable importance in shaping the structure and function of social networks.","Amir Ghasemian, Nicholas A. Christakis",Hemeryck,Social Networks I,6,,648

We explore this idea by analyzing unique historical data from the Warring States period of medieval Japan, where 2,222 clans engaged in 2,889 battles over 133 years. Our network analysis reveals a temporal shift in the topological location of battles and warring actors. Specifically, we delineate a fragmentation phase (1467–1566), characterized by instability and decentralized conflict, followed by a unification phase (1566–1600), distinguished by centralized conflict. By extending classical balance theory to state-like actors, these findings provide insights into the role of negative ties in long-term social destabilization and stabilization cycles. Finally, we examine how Japan's distinctive geography—defined by its long, arc-shaped archipelago—has influenced the dynamics of unification, suggesting that geographical constraints, alongside collective networks and historical trajectories, may shape political systems and determine whether a region unifies under a centralized structure or remains polarized into rival factions.","Amir Ghasemian, Hirokazu Shirado, Nicholas D.

These two networks can differ in substantial ways. The methodological choice of which network to study, therefore, is an important aspect in both study design and data analysis. In this work, we consider various key differences between household and individual social network structure, and ways in which the networks cannot be used interchangeably. In addition to formalizing the choices for representing each network, we explore the consequences of how the results of social network analysis change depending on the choice between studying the individual and household network---from determining whether networks are assortative or disassortative to the ranking of influence-maximizing nodes. As our main contribution, we draw upon related work to propose a set of systematic recommendations for determining the relevant network representation to study. Our recommendations include assessing a series of entitativity criteria and relating these criteria to theories and observations about patterns and norms in social dynamics at the household level: notably, how information spreads within households and how power structures and gender roles affect this spread. We draw upon the definition of an illusion of entitativity to identify cases wherein grouping people into households does not satisfy these criteria or adequately represent given cultural or experimental contexts. Given the widespread use of social network data for studying communities, there is broad impact in understanding which network to study and the consequences of that decision. We hope that this work gives guidance to practitioners and researchers collecting and studying social network data.","Izabel Pirimai Aguiar, Philip S.

We show how such networks can be used to analyse occupational clustering. We recover known results such as the manual/non-manual distinction and micro-class reproduction based the distribution of occupations within the kinship network. We also show that occupational reproduction happens far beyond the extended family. Using the entire population networks avoids having to privilege some relationships over others (parent-child, partner, siblings etc.) and contributes to moving analyses of social stratification and mobility beyond the nuclear family [6, 7, 3]. Jonsson et al [4] argued that “much of what shows up as big-class reproduction in conventional mobility analyses is in fact occupational reproduction in disguise.” They show that most of the “big class” reproduction (between fathers and children) takes place at a very fine occupational level: if children of lawyers are over-represented among high-prestige occupations, it is because they disproportionately often become lawyers. [2] replied that “the microclass approach does not deal in a theoretically consistent way with the remaining associational underlying patterns of occupational mobility,” highlighting that occupational reproduction was weaker for females, and that Jonsson et al.’s “micro- class” reproduction accounts for only half of overall class reproduction. We argue that apprehending social class via a dyadic perspective, i.e. focusing on parent-child measures, fundamentally restricts our analyses. Extending our view to an entire societal segment linked via descent gives us a more comprehensive picture of the distance between and cohesion within occupations. Figure 1 (p. 3) illustrates how we derive distances between occupations based on the kinship relations of individuals. We calculate all pairwise distances in the network. We then summarize each distribution of distances from individuals of one occupation to individuals of another, e.g. from bakers to bus drivers, by calculating the normalized area under the empirical cumulative distribution function $\hat{F}(d)$, $nAUC$. It is equal to 0 when all observed distances are equal to the maximum distance. It is equal to 1 when all observed distances are equal to the minimum possible distance. $$\hat{F}(d) = \frac{1}{d_{max}}\sum_{i=1}^{d_{max}} 1_{x_i\leq d}, \quad AUC = \sum_{d=1}^{d_{max}} \hat{F}(d),\quad nAUC = \frac{AUC - d_{min}}{d_{max} - d_{min}}$$ This study uses individual-level microdata from Statistics Sweden: We use the total population register (1968-2019) to link parents and children and the longitudinal integra- tion database for health insurance and labour market studies (2001–2019) for information on occupations. We restrict our sample to individuals born in 1968 or later and having an occupation between 2001 and 2018, for computational tractability. Individuals are linked by biological descent, but we consider the edges undirected. The resulting largest connected component, i.e. every individual can be reached from every other individual, comprises 502 500 individuals and 621 471 edges, having 355 unique occupations (at the 4-digit level). The distribution of distances among individuals of the same occupation is left-shifted compared to the distribution of distances between individuals of different occupations (figure 2). In other words, individuals of the same occupation are more likely to be genealogically close. This is true far beyond distances characterizing the extended family (e.g. cousins are distance 4). Occupations cluster at all levels of granularity, clustering is consistent across levels, and clusters have high face validity. Figure 3 shows the clustering of occupations at the 2- and 1-digit level (more interpretable than the more granular levels), based on Ward D2 linkeage of euclidean-distance transformed $nAUC$. One can clearly see the split between manual and non-manual occupations, and, within the latter, between office and service workers, on the one hand, and professionals and associated occupations on the other. We show a new way to quantify social structure based on complete population net- works. We recover known patterns of occupational reproduction and clustering based solely on kinship links. Occupational reproduction beyond the extended family could be dynastic, by descent, or homophilic, by marriage. This approach is straightforward to extend to education, income, and other dimensions of interest.

Consequently, we lack knowledge about even the most basic topological features of the societal-scale instant messenger network. To overcome this knowledge gap, we employ the innovative approach of data donation by respondents of a high-quality probability-based panel in the Netherlands (the LISS panel) to collect user data while preserving their privacy. Focusing on WhatsApp as the most popular MIMS, this study collects the first measurement of MIMS usage on a national probability sample. We find that the degree distribution of contacts is best approximated by a log-normal distribution, while the distribution of group membership is best approximated by the exponential distribution. At the individual level, we find that predictors of degree derived from the literature on extended networks mostly replicate.","Rense Corten, Laura Boeschoten, Thijs Carrière, Stein Jongerius, Bella Struminskaya, Joris Mulder, Parisa Zahedi, Shiva Nadi Najafabadi, Adriënne Mendrik",Hemeryck,Social Networks II,4,,140

Network-based methods have proven successful in detecting coordination in social media, for example to identify deceptive attempts to increase the visibility of social media posts and websites. While time is fundamental in these methods, to define when two actors are coordinated, little attention has been dedicated to the longitudinal dynamics of coordination. In this work we examine the suitability of different temporal network analysis methods for the longitudinal study of online coordination, where the network is split into temporal slices and communities are traced over time. Our results confirm early evidence that a longitudinal approach can find more traces of coordination and reveal dynamic patterns that are otherwise lost in a static analysis. At the same time, we raise questions about the validity of existing design choices, their consequences, and suggest associated guidelines.","Luca Rossi, Matteo Magnani",Hemeryck,Social Networks II,6,,727

This study investigates how media outlets in the U.S. navigated this dynamic on Facebook between 2015 and 2019. Using a publicly available dataset of over 2.2 million posts from 29 media outlets, we analyze the extent to which ideological alignment or distance dictates these strategies. First, we use topic modelling and causal inference techniques to estimate the flow of influence between every pair of outlets. Then, we use these estimated influence scores to construct imitation and differentiation networks, and use graph regression techniques -- specifically, Quadratic Assignment Procedure (QAP) approaches -- to find strong evidence for differentiation. Differentiation, however, is notable only in the coverage of partisan political topics -- where ideologically distant outlets deliberately diverge from each other in choosing what news topics to cover. In contrast, imitation dynamics, where outlets replicate others' content, are not significant for either partisan political or entertainment topics. We also observe a partisan asymmetry in differentiation: left-leaning outlets exhibit a stronger tendency to differentiate from right-leaning competitors. Our work offers novel insights into the complex interplay of media strategies in a digital landscape, and has implications for the future of online news and its relationship with political processes.","Subhayan Mukerjee, Tian Yang, Yilang Peng",Vingen 3+4,Social Media & Networks,1,,122

A key challenge in moderation is scalability, particularly in systems that rely on volunteer efforts. Understanding how moderation functions and scales in decentralized communities is crucial for their sustainability. This study examines Mastodon’s moderation practices by analyzing community rules across servers of different sizes. We categorize these rules to identify key governance priorities, finding that smaller communities focus disproportionately on a few topics, while larger instances maintain a more balanced emphasis. We also explore the relationship between rule lexical features and instance size, showing that as communities grow, rule scope expands while linguistic diversity declines. Finally, we find that instance size strongly predicts all aspects of rule lexical features. Federation connections, while playing a role, can only explain the expansion of rule scope.","Rasika Muralidharan, Bao Tran Truong, Yong-Yeol Ahn",Vingen 3+4,Social Media & Networks,2,,752

Although large-scale online data and automated techniques have enabled the quantitative analysis of uncivil discourse, prior research has predominantly focused on impoliteness or toxicity, often overlooking other behaviors that undermine democratic values. To address this gap, we propose a multidimensional conceptual framework encompassing violations of etiquette, legibility, pluralism, and democratic freedom norms. Using this framework, we measure the spread of online political incivility in Brazil using approximately 5 million tweets posted by 2,307 political influencers during the 2022 Brazilian general election. Through statistical modeling and network analysis, we examine the dynamics of uncivil posts at different election stages, identify key disseminators and audiences, and explore the mechanisms driving the spread of uncivil information online. Our findings indicate that impoliteness is more likely to surge during election campaigns. In contrast, the other dimensions of incivility are often triggered by specific violent events. Moreover, we find that left-aligned individual influencers are the primary disseminators of online incivility. They create uncivil content and amplify uncivil content from politicians, media agents, and individuals to reach broader audiences, revealing a diffusion pattern mixing the direct and two-step flows of communication theory. Consequently, a feedback loop may exist between right-wing offline violent actions and left-wing uncivil online responses, potentially harming democracy. This study offers new insights into the multidimensional nature of incivility in Brazilian politics and provides a conceptual framework that can be extended to other political contexts.","Yuan Zhang, Alexandre Bovet, Laia Castro Herrero, Michael Amsler, Frank Esser",Vingen 3+4,Social Media & Networks,3,,183

Although multiple factors contribute to the participation in activism, their complex relationships and the scarcity of data on their interactions have restricted most prior research to studying them in isolation, thus preventing the development of a quantitative, causal understanding of why people approach activism. In this work, we develop a comprehensive causal model of how and why Reddit users engage with activist communities driving mass climate protests (mainly the 2019 Earth Strike, Fridays for Future, and Extinction Rebellion). Our framework, based on Stochastic Variational Inference applied to Bayesian Networks, learns the causal pathways over multiple time periods. Distinct from previous studies, our approach uses large-scale and fine-grained longitudinal data (2016 to 2022) to jointly model the roles of sociodemographic makeup, experience of extreme weather events, exposure to climate-related news, and social influence through online interactions. We find that among users interested in climate change, participation in online activist communities is indeed influenced by direct interactions with activists and largely by recent exposure to media coverage of climate protests. Among people aware of climate change, left-leaning people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are particularly represented in online activist groups. Our findings offer empirical validation for theories of media influence and critical mass, and lay the foundations to inform interventions and future studies to foster public participation in collective action.","Jacopo Lenti, Corrado Monti, Luca Maria Aiello, Gianmarco De Francisci Morales",Vingen 3+4,Social Media & Networks,4,,519

Analyzing forwarded messages as a weighted directed network, we identify the core ""propagators""—channels central to content amplification. A two-sample test of proportions shows that in some of the far-right communities, hub channels disproportionately spread harmful content, while in others, harmful discourse is more decentralized. Our findings underscore the structural role of key amplifiers in shaping extremist narratives on Telegram. Our work also paves the path for future work to examine cross-community message passing and temporal trends, particularly leading up to the 2024 U.S. elections, to assess how network shifts influence harmful content dissemination in far-right online spaces.","Upasana Dutta, Yasmine Houri",Vingen 3+4,Social Media & Networks,5,,904
2025-07-24 11:00:00,2025-07-24 12:30:00,session_presentation,The Reddit Network of Mental Health Support,"Over the past few decades, research has documented a significant rise in mental health issues [1], highlighting a growing disconnect between advancements in health sciences and the psychological challenges individuals face. Simultaneously, social media has reshaped mental health support, enabling peer-driven interactions that help us look into mental health through lived experiences [2, 3]. Platforms like Reddit have become valuable spaces for individuals seeking guidance, sharing personal stories, and navigating mental health difficulties—often filling gaps left by the formal healthcare system. Unlike traditional forms of support, Reddit’s decentralized and anonymous nature encourages open expression and a sense of safety, making it particularly useful for studying stigmatized conditions. In this work, by examining Reddit as a system of disorder associations, we aim to uncover the implicit structures that shape mental health discourse, connecting clinical knowledge with peer-to-peer support. We present a network of mental disorders, symptoms, and addiction associations extracted from mental health support discussions on Reddit spanning five years (from 2019 to 2024). By conducting an expert review of the 20,000 most popular subreddits, we curated a list of 113 mental health support communities dedicated to a specific condition. Each subreddit was then categorized into 63 conditions and 15 disorder categories as delineated in the DSM‐V‐TR [4]. The final dataset comprises 4.1M public posts from 1.62 million users, offering a comprehensive view of the digital landscape of mental health discourse. The network is constructed by linking conditions based on statistically significant overlaps (Bonferroni-corrected $p<0.05$) in user participation across their respective subreddits. The resulting network is sparse (graph density of 0.071), yet it forms a single giant component comprising 104 out of 113 subreddits—a strong indication of the interconnectedness of mental health conditions (Figure 1). This giant component follows a modular structure (weighted betweenness Girvan-Newman modularity $Q_{max} = 0.668$ [5]), with groups of subreddits that are more strongly connected within than between groups. Here, we examine two types of edges in the network: - Intra-category (56.44\% of edges) -- linking two subreddits that provide support focused on a single condition category (e.g., BingeEatingDisorder and r/AnorexiaNervosa, both in the category of Feeding and Eating Disorders). - Inter-category (43.56\% of edges) -- linking two subreddits that provide support for different conditions (e.g., r/bipolar and r/BorderlinePDisorder, the first belonging to Bipolar Disorders and the latter to Personality Disorders). The inter-category edges reveal the non-trivial modular structure of the network, linking pairs of conditions either comorbid or similar in their symptomatology. The most central inter-category subreddits, r/C-PTSD (complex PTSD) and r/dpdr (depersonalization-derealization disorder), focus on conditions tied to prolonged trauma—-well-documented risk factors for other mental health disorders [6,7]. Our analysis of the hierarchical modular structure of the network shows that it does not fully match the diagnostic categorization defined in the DSM‐V‐TR (Figure 2). This demonstrates that user behavior on social media reveals patterns of similarity between diagnoses that differ from clinical categorizations. Specifically, we observe several cross-category clusters, such as Dissociations and Trauma, Personality Disorders and Psychotic Disorders, and Anxiety and Panic Disorders. In the clustering with the highest modularity in the hierarchy ($Q_{max}$), only two major clusters emerge: a smaller one comprising substance abuse and sleep disorders, and a larger cluster including the remaining conditions. These findings add to the growing evidence that clinical taxonomies do not fully capture the complexities of lived mental health experiences, reinforcing the need for alternative classifications grounded in broader behavioral data [8, 9]. Our findings reveal that the mental health support discourse on Reddit is strongly interconnected, with trauma and depersonalization conditions at the core of our network. Although the network is highly modular, the groups emerging from user behavior do not fully align with the clinical taxonomy of disorders, with users experiencing similarities between diagnoses in ways that differ from traditional clinical categorizations. Overall, the study offers a unique perspective on the co‐occurrence of mental health conditions as discussed in digital social spaces. By broadening the research focus beyond individuals actively seeking medical care, this work highlights the experiences of those who self-manage their symptoms, encounter barriers to healthcare, or find traditional support insufficient.","Bojan Evkoski, Srebrenka Letina, Petra Kralj Novak",Vingen 3+4,Social Media & Networks,6,,703

2025-07-23 11:00:00,2025-07-23 12:30:00,session_presentation,Measuring political activity on Facebook using donated data,"Introduction. In recent years, contrasting and integrating survey and digital trace data has emerged as a promising approach to enhance our understanding of human behavior in the digital age. Research that has so far aimed at comparing the two data sources has shown mixed results, with only weak/moderate correlations between the data collected by the two methods. These results highlight the validity problems of survey data but also point out that it is not always possible to match digital data with theoretical concepts well and that different validity issues may arise with digital data, too. In this study, we compare self-reported social media usage with data from digital footprints. As political content consumption is a key topic in many studies using digital data, our primary focus is on how we can measure it in donated Facebook (FB) data and how these measures align with survey self-reports. Data and Methods. Between February and June 2023, we conducted a complex data collection in Hungary, in which we asked participants to fill out a questionnaire and share their social media data with us alongside the survey. For data sharing, we used a data donation approach. We asked respondents for access to FB and Google data. In this study, we use the donated FB data and contrast it with survey questions about FB usage. We use the same questions to measure the frequency of different activities on FB (posting, sharing, reacting, commenting) on different topics (in general and about politics) In the survey, we used a seven-grade scale to measure activity frequency. We used three data types from the FB data packages: comments, reactions, and posts. The basis of all our digital measures was the number of specified activities within a given timeframe. To measure political activity, we had to take an additional step: We needed to identify the political content within the donated FB data. For this, we used three different approaches: text classification, manual page classification, and page classification by FB. Besides varying the different approaches to measuring political activity, we also varied the timeframe of the digital data. Results. In the first step of the analysis, we compare the correlation of general activity frequencies measured by the survey and measured by digital data. Correlations were between 0.3 and 0.6. We found the lowest correlation for post-activity and the highest for sharing. The correlations also differ regarding the time frame used in the analysis. When we used the last 30 days of the respondents' digital data to measure the activity frequencies, we found weaker correlations than when we used longer periods. Measuring the political activity with FB data is even more challenging based on the correlations. Regarding post and share data, the correlations were below 0.2. The results for reactions and comments were more promising. The correlations were just slightly weaker for political content than for general activities. We did not find huge differences between the manual and automatic page classification approaches, but narrower categories worked better than strict ones in most cases. For comments, we could compare all approaches. Text classification produces the same level of correlation with survey data as the page classification methods. Even if there are no differences in correlations, there might be differences between the frequencies derived with different approaches. We categorized the continuous political comment estimates into the 7 ordinal categories used in the survey. Based on the raw distributions, the narrower automatic classification yielded the most similar result to the survey result. The other approaches underestimate the frequency of political commenting. Discussion. In this paper, we used donated digital data to measure general and political activities and contrasted these results with survey data. The average correlation level between digital and survey data was around 0.4, corroborating the findings of previous studies. However, some activity types (e.g., posts) were difficult to estimate through the DDPs. Using too short periods could lead to biased estimations if surveys are treated as reference measures. Estimating political content is even more challenging for certain activities.","Zoltan Kmetty, Adam Stefkovics",Vingen 3+4,Social Media I,1,,801

These restrictions are impeding robust research pertaining to social and political phenomena online, which is critical due to the profound impact social media platforms may have on our societies. Here, we investigate the reliability of polarization measures obtained from different samples of social media data by studying the structural polarization of the Polish political debate on Twitter over a 24-hour period. First, we show that the political discussion on Twitter is only a small subset of the wider Twitter discussion. Second, we find that large samples can be representative of the whole political discussion on a platform, but small samples consistently fail to accurately reflect the true structure of polarization online. Finally, we demonstrate that keyword-based samples can be representative if keywords are selected with great care, but that poorly selected keywords can result in substantial political bias in the sampled data. Our findings demonstrate that it is not possible to measure polarization in a reliable way with small, sampled datasets, highlighting why the current lack of research data is so problematic, and providing insight into the practical implementation of the European Union's Digital Service Act which aims to improve researchers' access to social media data.","Gabriele Di Bona, Emma Fraxanet, Björn Komander, Andrea Lo Sasso, Virginia Morini, Antoine Vendeville, Max Falkenberg, Alessandro Galeazzi",Vingen 3+4,Social Media I,2,,93
2025-07-23 11:00:00,2025-07-23 12:30:00,session_presentation,Not so bad after all: cross-country estimates of prevalence of and engagement with negative content in political and non-political news on Facebook,"Negativity is a core characteristic of news and so the saying “if it bleeds, it leads” has described journalistic decisions about what to cover for decades. As a result, news outlets tend to produce and share negative content online and on platforms, and this tendency has been increasing in recent years. This is in part because negativity generates more attention, stimulates information seeking and—among some citizens—promotes engagement with news, and greater news sharing on platforms. Here, we advance extant work on negativity in news in the following key ways. First, we offer large-scale comparative evidence on the prevalence of and engagement with negative news on social media. Because most research comes from the U.S., it is not clear whether the findings generalize to other countries. Second, most past work examines user engagement with all negative articles produced by a news organization without differentiating between news about politics versus non-political topics or focuses on strictly political contexts without direct comparisons against a non-political baseline. Despite the importance of negativity in news coverage of candidates, elections, social groups, among other political issues, missing are at-scale estimates of the differential prevalence of and engagement with negativity in political vs. non-political news across countries. Third, we integrate three distinct engagement behaviors studied separately in past work. We examine the liking and sharing of negative news and also commenting on such news content. These behaviors reflect distinct affordances of platforms and have different implications for users themselves and online discourse at large. Furthermore, we put in perspective extant concerns about negativity in online communication by examining the relative volume of engagement with negative and positive news on platforms. We account for the differential prevalence of negative and non-negative news, aiming to provide more accurate conclusions regarding the actual volume of user engagement with negativity in political and non-political news. Lastly, methodologically, we offer a comprehensive approach to negativity and provide a validated multilingual classifier to capture—at scale, automatically, and in a reliable way—the presence of negativity in news. Following past conceptual work, we combine “the mere dissemination of negative news” (exogenous negativity coming into the news from outside, that is, from the topic itself) and media-initiated negativity (“endogenous negativity imposed on news by journalists through their use of language”). We use 6,081,134 Facebook posts published between January 1, 2020, and April 1, 2024, by 97 news media organizations in six countries. In particular, we use data on posts published by 37 major U.S.-based news outlets (2,274,210 posts), 12 outlets from the United Kingdom (959,141 posts), 11 from Ireland (451,783), 17 from Poland (842,321 posts), 8 from France (355,697 posts), and 12 news outlets from Spain (1,197,982 posts). For each post published by each news outlet, we obtained the text content, posting time, and the core interaction metrics — numbers of likes, comments, and shares. To identify political and negative news content, we develop two multilingual binary classifiers for automated labeling, both based on a moderately large transformer model known as XLM-RoBERTa-Large, and use them to label all posts as political/other and negative/other. This allows us to estimate the prevalence of negativity in political and non-political posts published by all analyzed news outlets as well as the users’ engagement with such news posts. We use those data to systematically and comparatively test four questions: (1) Is news about politics more negative overall than non-political news?; (2) What are the differences in the levels of negativity in political and non-political news across the tested countries? (3) What are the relative levels of users’ engagement — in terms of likes, comments, and shares — with negative news in general and also negative political and negative non-political news in particular? Lastly, (4) what are the relative levels of user engagement with negative news and with political versus non-political news when accounting for the prevalence of negative versus non-negative news?","Szymon Talaga, Magdalena Wojcieszak, Dominik Batorski",Vingen 3+4,Social Media I,3,,321

Yet most research studies a single platform—typically Twitter/X, or occasionally Facebook—leaving little known about the broader social media landscape. Here we shed new light on patterns of cross-platform variation in the high-stakes context of news sharing. We examine the relationship between user engagement and news domains’ political orientation and quality across seven platforms: Twitter/X, BlueSky, TruthSocial, Gab, GETTR, Mastodon, and LinkedIn. Using an exhaustive sampling strategy, we analyze all (over 10 million) posts containing links to news domains shared on these platforms during January 2024. We find that the news shared on platforms with more conservative user bases is significantly lower quality on average. Turning to patterns of engagement, we find—contrary to hypotheses of a consistent “right wing advantage” on social media—that the relationship between political lean and engagement is strongly heterogeneous across platforms. Conservative new posts receive more engagement on platforms where most content is conservative, and vice versa for liberal news posts, consistent with an “echo platform” perspective. In contrast, the relationship between news quality and engagement is strikingly consistent: across all platforms examined, lower-quality news posts received higher average engagement even though higher quality news is substantially more prevalent and garners far more total engagement across posts. This pattern holds despite accounting for poster-level variation, and is observed even in the absence of ranking algorithms, suggesting user preferences – not algorithmic – bias may underlie the underperformance of higher-quality news.","Mohsen Mosleh, Jennifer Allen, David Rand",Vingen 3+4,Social Media I,4,,77

Please see the pdf file for full abstract. Negative expressions are among the most hotly debated phenomena in contemporary society. Here we present a new theory of motivation to be unique as a driver of social media negativity. The premise of our theory is Tolstoy’s old adage that “all happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Tolstoy’s suggestion, which has now been validated in psychological studies, is that negativity is more heterogeneous than positivity (Alves et al., 2017). A pursuit of uniqueness can therefore lead to a descent into negativity. The main prediction from this account is a decline in affective valence over time on social media at multiple levels of analysis. Threads should become more negative over time as users find it more difficult to offer unique comments. Social media communities devoted to a topic should become more negative over time as it becomes more difficult to offer a unique perspective on the topic. We also hypothesize that there should be two crucial moderators of the trend towards negativity. The first moderator is initial valence: the effect should be most prominent when content starts off as positive. When initial posts or comments are positive, it is easier to differentiate oneself through negativity. The second moderator is group size: the effect should be most pronounced in larger groups. In a sufficiently small community, it should be less challenging to differentiate oneself than in a very large community, and the pull towards negativity therefore should not be so great. Methods and Results We tested these hypotheses using a combination of naturalistic data and controlled experiments to balance internal and external validity. Naturalistic Data. We retrieved naturalistic data from 2,150 “subreddit” communities on Reddit (2.05 billion comments) from 2010 – 2022 (see Figure 1). As predicted, we found that affective valence became more negative over time in comment threads, b = -0.001, SE = 0.0002, t = -7.57, p < 0.001, and in subreddits, b = 0.02, SE = 0.004, t = -5.37, p < 0.001. In subsequent analyses, we stress-tested our mechanism through mediation and moderation. If people are expressing negativity out of a motivation to be unique, then the rise of negativity over time should be mediated by increases in semantic uniqueness. Using an established measure of semantic uniqueness (Hoffman et al., 2013; Shi et al., 2019), we found this mediation in our thread, 95% CIs [-0.287, -0.140] (see Figure 2.). In terms of moderation, we predicted that the rise of negativity should be largest when discussions were initially positive, and when threads and communities contained many different users. We found support for both of these moderators. Initial positivity, b = -0.05, SE = 0.002, t = -31.17, p < 0.001, and number of unique users, b = -0.01, SE = 0.001, t = -9.05, p < 0.001, both moderated the trend towards negativity over time. Experimental Data. We next conducted two pre-registered experiments in which participants (n = 5,000) contributed posts to an evolving social media feed over five generations. In both experiments, participants saw news stories that were pre-tested to vary in their affective valence. The first generation of participants were instructed to write a post reflecting on the news story. Then the next generation saw the news story followed by a random subset (n =20) of posts from the previous generation. In Experiment 1, we test whether participants’ posts become more negative over subsequent generations, and whether this effect is greatest when people comment on positive articles (high initial positivity) versus negative articles (low initial positivity). In Experiment 2, we replicate the effect and further showed that the effect was stronger when people sought to be unique (via a monetary bonus awarded to the person who contributed the most unique perspective on the news topic), vs. conformist (via a monetary bonus for the person who mirrored previous perspectives). In both studies, we found the hypothesized generation * initial positivity interaction, p < 0.001, confirming that discussions have a higher valance decline overtime when they start off positively. In Experiment 2, we also found our hypothesized interaction with uniqueness condition. When participants were incentivized to contribute unique perspectives, we observed the expected interaction between generation and time, b = -0.04, SE = 0.01, t = -3.42, p < 0.001. However, when they were incentivized to contribute conformist perspectives, the interaction was in the opposite direction, b = 0.03, SE = 0.01, t = 3.28, p < 0.001, suggesting that initial positivity encouraged more positivity—the reverse of what we observed in naturalistic data.","Hongkai Mao, Joshua Conrad Jackson, Yutong Jiang, Alex Koch, Yuan Chang Leong, William J Brady",Vingen 3+4,Social Media I,5,,918

Online platforms require order despite lacking centralized control, reflecting how human communities develop governance systems even without formal authority. While rules have traditionally been studied as static entities, their evolution—especially in online communities—remains poorly understood. We address this gap by analyzing rule changes across 13,000 Reddit communities over a decade, identifying four key evolutionary pathways: institutional diffusion (communities adopting successful rules from elsewhere), boundary spanning (moderators transferring rules between communities), exogenous shocks (external events prompting rule changes), and organizational scaling (communities developing more formal structures as they grow). Reddit's decentralized structure provides a natural experiment for observing governance evolution across thousands of semi-independent communities operating within the same framework. Using temporal data that captures both rule changes and moderator activity, we move beyond static analyses to examine the dynamics of rule creation and adaptation. Our initial findings suggest that ""low effort"" rules gained traction rapidly after 2013, civility rules transitioned from prohibitive restrictions to constructive guidance, and hate speech regulations were adopted in synchronized patterns across subreddits. These trends indicate that governance on Reddit is influenced by both internal community behaviors and external societal pressures. Understanding these mechanisms informs broader discussions on governance and institutional design while offering practical insights for platform policy development. By examining how rules evolve and persist, our research sheds light on the mechanisms that drive self-regulation in online communities and how digital governance structures adapt over time","Katherine Van Koevering, Shambhobi Bhattacharya, Hyejin Youn, Jon Kleinberg",Vingen 3+4,Social Media I,6,,871

In this paper, we expand the literature on digital propaganda by introducing the concept of ""intimate propaganda"", which captures how governments craft narratives that foster a psychologically close relationship between audiences and the state. To test whether governments create more intimate propaganda on social media than traditional media, we focus on Xinwen Lianbo, China’s flagship television broadcaster, and compare propaganda videos from its flagship TV broadcast to its social media channel (Douyin, or Chinese TikTok) over twelve months from June 2020 to June 2021. We construct variables measuring intimacy across video (face proportion, happiness), audio (tempo, pitch), and text (informality, pronoun usage, slang), and find that Douyin is more intimate across most of them. Furthermore, we find that depictions of political leaders are the exception to this intimacy -- despite literature in democratic contexts showing the importance of message personalization, we find that in an authoritarian context leaders are held aloof. Our research contributes to the literature on digital propaganda, political message personalization, and multimodal content analysis.","Matt DeButts, Yingdan Lu",Vingen 3+4,Social Media II,1,,492

Among these platforms, Twitter has served as a critical space for real-time news dissemination and political discussion (Zhang et al., 2021). However, major shifts in platform governance can have profound effects on information ecosystems. In October 2022, Elon Musk acquired Twitter and implemented sweeping policy changes, including reduced content moderation, reinstatement of previously banned accounts, and algorithmic adjustments that influenced content visibility (Frenkel & Conger, 2022). These transformations raised concerns about their potential impact on information quality, misinformation dynamics, and the broader health of digital public spheres (Wojcieszak et al., 2022). This study investigates whether these concerns are empirically reflected in shifts in Twitter’s information quality. Specifically, it examines how information credibility changed before and after Musk’s acquisition, contributing to ongoing debates on platform governance, misinformation regulation, and content moderation (Vaidhyanathan, 2018; Zhuravskaya et al., 2020). While previous research has analyzed the effects of algorithmic curation on misinformation exposure (Guess et al., 2020; Pennycook & Rand, 2019), the role of sudden leadership-driven policy changes remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, this study assesses how corporate governance decisions can reshape digital information environments. To analyze these dynamics, two large-scale datasets are used: the Twitter Panel, a representative sample of U.S. users, and the Decahose, a 10% random sample of all global tweets. Information quality is measured using established domain credibility scores, capturing engagement patterns with high- and low-credibility sources. Interrupted time series (ITS) analysis is employed to assess whether observable shifts in information quality coincide with Musk’s takeover (Grinberg et al., 2019; Guess et al., 2020). Findings reveal a statistically significant decline in information quality following the acquisition. Prior to the takeover, engagement with high-credibility sources exhibited an increasing trend, suggesting gradual improvements in information quality. However, after Musk assumed control, this trajectory reversed, showing a measurable increase in interactions with low-credibility domains and a reduction in exposure to reliable sources. These shifts are consistent across both datasets and remain robust across multiple operationalizations of information quality. These results highlight the influence of platform governance on information integrity. As social media platforms continue to shape political discourse, ownership-driven policy shifts—particularly those that relax content moderation—can have immediate and measurable effects on digital information ecosystems. The study’s findings contribute to discussions on platform regulation, misinformation control, and the role of private entities in governing public discourse (Napoli, 2019; Vaidhyanathan, 2018). Given the growing reliance on digital platforms for news consumption, understanding how governance decisions shape information quality is critical for researchers, policymakers, and platform designers.","Burak Ozturan, David Lazer, Nir Grinberg, Alexi Quintana Mathé",Vingen 3+4,Social Media II,2,,881

To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, multilingual dataset capturing all Wikipedia links shared in posts and comments on Reddit from 2020 to 2023, excluding those from private and NSFW subreddits. Each linked Wikipedia article is enriched with revision history, page view data, article ID, redirects, and Wikidata identifiers. Through a research agreement with Reddit, our dataset ensures user privacy while providing a query and ID mechanism that integrates with the Reddit and Wikipedia APIs. This enables extended analyses for researchers studying how information flows across platforms. For example, Reddit discussions use Wikipedia for deliberation and fact-checking which subsequently influences Wikipedia content, by driving traffic to articles or inspiring edits. By analyzing the relationship between information shared and discussed on these platforms, our dataset provides a foundation for examining the interplay between social media discourse and collaborative knowledge consumption and production.","Patrick Gildersleve, Anna Beers, Viviane Ito, Agustin Orozco, Francesca Bolla Tripodi",Vingen 3+4,Social Media II,4,,766
2025-07-23 14:30:00,2025-07-23 16:00:00,session_presentation,"Understanding Diffusion in Social Media: Non-Exponential Growth, Topic Locality, and Infection Dynamics","Quantitative research on diffusion phenomena in society began in the early 20th century with the work of Chapin and is best known for Rogers' theory of the diffusion of innovation [1,2]. The field has been studied for over a century and diffusion processes are classically described by an S-curve, which can be approximated by the logistic equation. The S-curve initially exhibits exponential growth before converging to a constant value determined by the carrying capacity of the environment. This characteristic has led to its application in various fields, including linguistics, where it describes the diffusion of new words, and marketing, where the logistic equation forms the basis of the Bass model. Other phenomena similar to these diffusion phenomena are infection dynamics such as diseases and rumors often described by Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model etc. These also have in common with the diffusion phenomena that the initial phase is modelled by an exponential increase. The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the growth curve of diffusion in social media. Specifically, we clarify the patterns of the growth curves and understand the mechanisms behind. Compared to previous studies, which often focused on individual word cases, this study aims to more systematically clarify the overall picture of growth curves by analyzing large-scale, long-term data.  Firstly, we systematically analyzed the growth curves of the diffusion of new words extracted from 10 billion blog posts in Japanese over a ten-year period from 2007 to 2019. We found that a non-exponential growth curve is the most common type (Figure 1). This typical curve is described by the following power-law type equation: $dx(t)/dt= rx(t)^α $ (1). The most common value of the exponent α is 0.5 (Figure 3), which is between the exponential growth (α = 1) and linear growth (α = 0). In general, we showed that more complex growth curves can be approximated using the equation: $\frac{dx(t)}{dt}= r x(t) (1+x(t)/X)^{α-1}$, where this equation corresponds to Eq. 1 for $X \to \infty$. Furthermore, we showed that these properties hold not only for Japanese blog data, but also for French, English, and Spanish [3]. Secondly, we investigated the relationship between the dominant parameter α in Eq. 1 and word meaning using two methods: word classification by LLM and the explanatory power of prediction by random forests. The results suggested that α was related to the ""locality of the topic"" (Table 1). Specifically, α was closer to 1 (i.e., exponential growth) for informative topics that are common both globally and across the entire country. In contrast, local and specialized experiential topics showed an α closer to 0 (i.e., linear growth). Thirdly, we introduced a simple agent-based infection model that takes into account the effect of the locality of the topic (Figure 2). In the model, the probability that the $i$-th infected person will infect a non-infected person is with probability p_i given by $p_i=1/(1+γk_i )$, where this probability decreases as the number of infected individuals $k_i$ around the $i$-th infected person increases. Here, γ is a parameter representing the locality of the topic, i.e., the ratio between the locality and globality of the topic. This agent-based model is connected to the typical power-law growth curve given by Eq. 1, and γ is directly linked to the power exponent $α = 1-γ$. The main contribution of this study is to systematically and clearly present the overall picture of continuous diffusion curves, based on the time series of one million words from a large, decade-long, nationwide blog dataset. These results are expected to provide a new perspective on the commonly used approach of observing long-term social changes through social media.

This study investigates how meme template adaptability—the capacity of a template to support diverse textual reinterpretations—affects its popularity trends. While previous research has explored meme diffusion through qualitative and computational approaches, the role of the adaptability of meme templates in shaping their popularity and diffusion remains underexamined. Using a dataset of approximately eight million memes from three major meme-related subreddits (memes, dankmemes, meme) spanning 2008–2023, this study identifies meme templates through HDBSCAN clustering. Meme adaptability is quantified using OCR-extracted text, sentence embeddings, and pairwise cosine similarity, where lower similarity indicates greater adaptability. Time-series modeling (ARIMAX) and Granger causality tests are applied to assess the temporal relationship between adaptability and popularity. Results indicate that higher adaptability is associated with slower popularity decay, even after controlling for factors such as maximum popularity and template size. Among the 10 most frequently occurring meme templates, adaptability in the current month strongly correlates with relative popularity. However, causality tests reveal mixed patterns—some templates show a positive effect, while others exhibit no clear relationship or an inverse trend. Additionally, in some cases, popularity influences subsequent adaptability, suggesting that viral memes may attract broader reinterpretations over time. These findings suggest that meme diffusion is shaped not only by adaptability but also by contextual and structural factors. Further analysis is needed to understand the role of emotional tone, topical relevance, and platform dynamics in modulating the adaptability-popularity relationship. By integrating computational modeling with theoretical insights, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of how meme templates evolve as communicative structures in digital culture.",Yingrong Mao,Vingen 3+4,Social Media II,7,,917

The model captures the influence of editorial agenda-setting, including alignment, amplification, and reframing, as well as community dynamics such as membership turnover, troll activity, and counterspeech. Our findings show how editorial practices can sustain echo chambers or challenge them through diversified narratives, and how community responses either reinforce or resist these influences.

Their active use provides opportunity to collect large-scale longitudinal data. We release a dataset for the DerStandard newspaper platform covering an entire decade. DerStandard, an Austrian newspaper founded in 1988, pioneered online presence in 1995 with chat rooms that evolved into forums where registered users post comments on articles. These forums are highly active with 247,864 users posting 75,644,850 comments between 2013-2022. The dataset includes extensive text data in user comments and behavioral measures such as up/down-votes (412,511,165 votes total). We include information on which user voted positively or negatively on which posts, enabling reconstruction of signed networks of online interaction. We provide publicly available information on articles that serve as the basis for user postings, including content tags by DerStandard staff. To facilitate use of textual data and preserve privacy, we provide pre-computed vector representations of all texts, created using the state-of-the-art ""KaLM-embedding-multilingual-mini-v1"" model from Hugging Face. DerStandard is a source of high-quality text as the platform uses semi-automatic moderation to remove automated accounts and unwanted content. Our release enables researchers to move beyond typical English-centric contributions by providing large-scale textual data in German, a medium-resourced language spoken by approximately 100 million people worldwide. The data should interest social scientists, as it covers many contentious political events in Austria. Despite being a smaller European nation, Austria is often viewed as a model for later developments in Germany and other Western European countries. Its central location makes it share features with bordering countries and presents an interesting case for social scientific research. This data was previously used in three studies: monitoring affective expressions of the DerStandard community during COVID-19; showing sentiment analysis of user comments tracks mood dynamics expressed in platform surveys; and extracting signed networks of user interactions to identify divisions between users, pinpointing issues that reinforce societal fault lines and contribute to polarization. Our technical validations confirm the quality of the provided embeddings. Vector similarity analyses show expected patterns: highest similarity scores occur between direct reply pairs, followed by comments in the same thread, with lowest similarity between any comment pairs under the same article. We also examined similarity distributions for comments under articles with different topic labels versus the same topic, finding cross-topic pairs generally have lower similarity scores. Among same-topic pairs, specific labels like ""football"" or ""Middle East"" exhibit higher similarities than broader categories like ""policy issues."" This dataset enables future research in several domains. It provides a unique resource for network science with large-scale, longitudinal, real-world ""found"" data that directly allows building networks of signed interactions between thousands of users. Previous work in signed networks either used small-scale data or proxy measures to assume interaction positivity/negativity. On the article level, content tags can serve as valuable gold standard labels for validating clustering approaches. For additional flexibility, we provide linkage to the ""One Million Post Corpus"" of DerStandard previously released by the Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence, containing full text and manually annotated labels for a data subset.","Emma Fraxanet, Vicenç Gomez, Andreas Kaltenbrunner, David Garcia, Max Pellert",Vingen 1+2,Media and Online Discourse I,2,,426

An NLP approach to the mainstreaming of far-right discourse in legacy media.,"The rise of far-right parties across Western democracies has prompted scholars to interrogate the media’s role in disseminating far-right messages, eventually consolidating their political stand (Moffitt 2018). While much focus has been placed on social media’s facilitation of far-right mobilization (Schradie 2019) and alternative conservative media (Della Vigna and Kaplan 2007), legacy media have also been largely studied. There are good reasons for this. Despite pervasive transformations of media ecosystems, they remain authoritative voices in the public sphere (Langer and Gruber 2021). Specifically, they play a key role in defining the boundaries of acceptable political discourse (Hallin 1989). Existing studies have examined their representation of far-right politics focusing on indicators such as the presence of far-right speakers in televised political shows (Cagé et al. 2022) or of far-right frames in journalistic writings (Wettstein et al. 2018). However, these now classic approaches only partially account for the process through which journalists give far-right actors a voice - both granting their visibility and shaping the conditions of their reception. Capturing this entails interrogating the extent to which far-right politicians are allowed to speak, and in which context. It also entails capturing how their discourse is framed and qualified through the work of journalists. One pathway to do so is to look at quotes. Quotes are a prime object of journalistic work. The place and form they take in journalistic content speaks of the deontological standards applied by journalists in the coverage of politics (Tuchman 1972). Most importantly, quotes reflect relationships of proximity or distance and of epistemic authority between journalists and politicians, over specific subjects and at specific points in time (Carlson 2009; Ekström et al. 2020). Yet, they are understudied sociological objects, partly because they are hard to apprehend at scale. To address this issue, we leverage recent advances in NLP to analyze how French legacy newspapers not only mention, but also quote politicians of different political orientations, including far-right, from the 1990s to the present. We set out to analyze quotes developing a novel methodology that combines: a) A sequence labeling algorithm, built on SpERT (Eberts and Ulges 2020) and FRACAS (Richard et al. 2023), which extracts from newspaper content “reported speech triplets” (quoted statement, source, reporting verb/phrase). b) A sequence-to-sequence algorithm on the model of BARThez (Eddine et al. 2020), which extracts the proper name of every quote’s source when possible, allowing to cluster quotes by individual. c) A database containing biographical information for French politicians to add relevant metadata to quoted political personalities. We applied this methodology on a large-scale corpus of political service articles from leading French newspapers, encompassing diverse editorial perspectives (Le Monde, Le Figaro, Libération). Using this data, we first quantify the voice given to far-right politicians vs. affiliated to other parties. We do so across outlets and over time. Our preliminary findings reveal correlations between the volume of quotes attributed to political factions, outlets’ political leaning, and national political events (elections, also terror attacks). Since the early 2010s, we also observe an upwards trend for quotes from far-right politicians in our corpus, with peaks corresponding to years when far-right candidates reached the second round of presidential elections (e.g. 2017). In parallel, we register a downward trend for center-left quotes. The strength of our method is that we can also qualify the voice given to the far-right. We can focus on the phrases used to introduce quoted statements. By computing odds ratios, we analyze the terms specifically used to introduce far-right discourse, and find clear tendencies over time. While the terms used in the early 2000s often denote an aggressive and adversarial attitude, detachment from reality, emotions generally considered unconventional in the political sphere, this is not the case two decades later. These verbs are often substituted by more neutral expressions, pointing to a clear normalization of far-right discourse in general media outlets. We also observe important inter-media differences. Verbs denoting uncontrolled anger or an adversarial attitude are more common in left-leaning outlets, while right-leaning papers delineate a more moderated portrayal of far-right statements. Building on these results, the presentation will i) introduce a novel methodology to analyze quoted statements in media content, ii) provide critical insights into the dynamics of media representation and normalization of far-right voices, iii) analyze the determinants of the voice given to the far-right over time, thus elucidating the factors that lead to the legitimation of these parties.","Emma Bonutti D'Agostini, Etienne Ollion",Vingen 1+2,Media and Online Discourse I,3,,240

Event-Driven Shifts in Meaning Networks across Newspaper and Online Discourses,"Sociological theorizing on meaning-making relies on network metaphors, yet empirical research has lagged behind in measuring relational meanings at scale. We conceptualize cultural meanings as networks of related interpretations in big text data from vastly different contributors. We use semi-supervised seeded topic modeling to identify meaning structures comparably across differences in language and text formats. As a case study, we investigate the convergence and divergence of immigration discourses between newspapers and online discussions in Sweden during a transformative period from 2008 to 2020. A longstanding question is whether crises disrupt meaning-making in ways that lead to divergence between discursive spheres, or foster interpretative convergence. In the short term, our results support the convergence story, as meaning networks in the newspapers and online become more aligned during the 2015--16 European `refugee crisis.' Convergence is driven by peripheral interpretations aligning bidirectionally, where both journalists and social media users move closer to each other’s perspectives. However, as the crisis subsides, meanings diverge, exceeding pre-crisis levels. Our methodology and results provide new insights into how crises synchronize and fragment public discourses across societal spheres.","Anastasia Menshikova, Miriam Hurtado Bodell, Måns Magnusson, Marc Keuschnigg",Vingen 1+2,Media and Online Discourse I,4,,148

While opinion dynamic models focus on interactions among individuals with differing viewpoints as drivers of opinion change, they often overlook how these interactions influence behavior without altering core beliefs. Understanding how individuals respond to feedback and how their choices impact others' behavior is increasingly important as more people engage with political content online. This study investigates how our need for connection influences our decisions to share opinions on contentious topics in online discussions. We propose an online experiment to examine whether online environments with a high incentive for connection give way to fear of isolation, thereby lowering willingness to express true opinions publicly. In our experiment, participants used an online interface to share opinions on controversial topics, with the option to conceal their views. They were encouraged to form connections and faced negative interactions if others disconnected or rejected them. Our study found that a high predisposition to share opinions, a strong belief in alignment with the majority, high attitude certainty, and issue importance all increase the likelihood of expressing opinions publicly. These findings support key aspects of the Spiral of Silence theory, which suggests that individuals are more likely to share their views when they believe their opinions align with the majority, have strong attitude certainty, and view the issue as important.","Gabriela Juncosa, Angel Sánchez, Julia Koltai, Taha Yasseri, Gerardo Iñiguez",Vingen 1+2,Media and Online Discourse II,1,,805

Masculine defaults involve three key parts: (i) the cultural context, (ii) the masculine characteristics or behaviors, and (iii) the reward for, or simply acceptance of, those masculine characteristics or behaviors. In this work, we study discourse-based masculine defaults, and propose a twofold framework for (i) the large-scale discovery and analysis of gendered discourse words in spoken content via our Gendered Discourse Correlation Framework (GDCF); and (ii) the measurement of the gender bias associated with these gendered discourse words in LLMs via our Discourse Word-Embedding Association Test (D-WEAT). We focus our study on podcasts, a popular and growing form of social media, analyzing 15,117 podcast episodes. We analyze correlations between gender and discourse words -- discovered via LDA and BERTopic -- to automatically form gendered discourse word lists. We then study the prevalence of these gendered discourse words in domain-specific contexts, and find that gendered discourse-based masculine defaults exist in the domains of business, technology/politics, and video games. Next, we study the representation of these gendered discourse words from a state-of-the-art LLM embedding model from OpenAI, and find that the masculine discourse words have a more stable and robust representation than the feminine discourse words, which may result in better system performance on downstream tasks for men. Hence, men are rewarded for their discourse patterns with better system performance by one of the state-of-the-art language models -- and this embedding disparity constitutes a representational harm and a masculine default.","Maria Teleki, Xiangjue Dong, Haoran Liu, James Caverlee",Vingen 1+2,Media and Online Discourse II,3,,417

Despite growing research on visual imagery in climate discussions, there is a gap in integrating advanced computational technologies like Vision-Language Models (VLLMs) to analyse these visuals. In this study, to fill this gap, we resorted to a dataset of 16,130 Facebook posts featuring images from both pro- and anti-climate action stakeholders. To analyze the visual discourse around the topic from both sides of the debate, we used LLM-enhanced visual clustering, employing GPT-4 for text labels and BERT embeddings for clustering. Six key visual facets of the climate discourse emerged, with two highly associated with right-wing political propaganda, and others focusing on sustainable practices and policies. We further explored the ideological dimensions by examining the presence of pro- and counter-actors in each visual cluster, finding that certain visual topics, such as wind turbines, triggered balanced engagement from both sides. Emotional polarization scores of posts revealed that anti-climate reactions were more negative, especially regarding sustainable practices. Overall, the study employed an innovative LLM-enhanced approach to the analysis of the image-based communication practices around climate change, detecting the heterogeneity of visual discourse in climate change, with ideological dominance shaping the framing of the debate.","Luigi Arminio, Luca Rossi",Vingen 1+2,Media and Online Discourse II,4,,195

Although research has highlighted the challenges faced by individual minority groups, the stigma process—labeling, stereotyping, separation, status loss, and discrimination—that underpin these experiences remains underexamined, particularly in the online spaces where college students are highly active. We address these gaps by examining posts on subreddit, r/college, as indicators for stigma processes, our approach applies a Stereotype-BERT model, including stance toward each stereotype. We extend the stereotype model to encompass status loss and discrimination by using semantic distance with their reference sentences. Our analyses show that professional indicated posts are primarily labeled under the stereotyping stage, whereas posts indicating racial are highly represented in status loss and discrimination. Intersectional identified posts are more frequently associated with status loss and discrimination. The findings of this study highlight the need for multifaceted intersectional approaches to identifying stigma, which subsequently serve as indicators to promote equity for minority groups, especially racial minorities and those experiencing compounded vulnerabilities due to intersecting identities.","Chaeeun Han, Sangpil Youm, Hojeong Yoo, Sou Hyun Jang",Vingen 1+2,Media and Online Discourse II,5,,160
2025-07-24 14:30:00,2025-07-24 16:00:00,session_presentation,Disentangling Participation in Online Political Discussions: A Collective Field Experiment on Reddit,"Online discussions are far from representative–most people passively consume political content and only a small group produces most posts and comments. This phenomenon can evoke distorted perceptions of opinion prevalence and discourse norms, potentially creating feedback loops of public opinion formation driven by opinions of a loud minority (Robertson et al., 2024). While previous studies describe characteristics of those who post actively (Kim et al., 2021; Bor & Petersen, 2022; Bright et al., 2019), we still know very little about the other side: What distinguishes the silent from those who do enter the arena (Matthes et al., 2018)? What leads users to drop out of discussions? Is there a way to mitigate the resulting participation inequality? In this field experiment, we created large customized discussion groups on Reddit that allow us to test these questions in a controlled but ecological environment and to obtain detailed information about passive users and their perceptions. We recruit social media users via Reddit Ads in the United States and randomly allocate them (N = 520) to one of six experimentally controlled private online communities on Reddit. In all six communities, participants discussed political issues over a period of four weeks, accompanied by weekly diary surveys and concluded by a post-survey (see Figure 1). We find that even in this controlled lab-in-the-field environment, the number of comments written is predicted by male gender and high political interest. Furthermore, those who write many comments appear to get encouraged by disagreement, perceived polarization and even toxicity in a discussion. An almost completely opposite picture emerges for whether someone decides to enter the discussion at all. Perceptions of a toxic and polarized environment characterize those who remain silent, while on the other hand, writing the first comment is predicted by the group being respectful, knowledgeable and constructive (Figure not displayed for brevity.). Over time, we find evidence for positive reinforcement of behavior through social feedback (see Figure 3). Incentivizing participants to consistently write comments decreased participation inequality whereas making participants aware of moderation norms backfired and increased comment toxicity (see Figure 2). Discussion roles, in the sense that few individuals lead discussions while most others take a backseat, appears to be a robust feature of political discussions, as the two experimental treatments did not fundamentally alter discussion behavior and downstream political opinion formation. However, the experimental treatments successfully changed the constellations of who was most active and buffered early drop-out from commenting. Our setup allows for comparing how passive and active participants perceive a discussion, and how they react to toxicity differently. These divergent predictive patterns of environmental factors for (or against) online participation have important implications for future understandings of participation inequality and dynamics of online public discourse.","Lisa Oswald, William Small Schulz, Philipp Lorenz-Spreen",Vingen 1+2,Media and Online Discourse II,6,,130

While enhancing user experience, they also drive filter bubbles, radicalization, polarization, and social inequality. With the rapid advancement of technologies such as large language models (LLMs), these effects may become increasingly pronounced. Consequently, it is imperative to examine AI-powered RecSys within the broader context of human-AI ecosystems. In this study, by auditing an LLM-assisted YouTube recommender system, we analyze how LLM-assisted RecSys can enhance user experience by providing more personalized recommendations and examine their potential to amplify societal polarization. In our methodology, first, the YouTube algorithm initiates the process of personalization using actual historical data. Next, the candidate videos curated by YouTube undergo a re-ranking process employing LLMs that have been meticulously fine-tuned through various prompting strategies to enhance personalization. We show that the integration of LLMs into personalization strategies may unintentionally promote exposure to problematic content. Lastly, we present results on refining prompts to reduce the risk of producing extreme content while also diversifying the recommended videos.","Amir Ghasemian, Homa Hosseinmardi, Upasana Dutta, Ziying Chen, Duncan J.

Despite their widespread use, these tools curate information under opaque algorithms, raising concerns about transparency, fairness, and potential bias. This study investigates whether SEs and LLMs display political bias in response to neutral election-related queries and examines whether such bias reflects external factors (e.g., media coverage or public polling) or is amplified by the platforms themselves. Using a web crawler-based methodology, we simulated user interactions with SEs (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo) and LLMs (Copilot, ChatGPT) during the 2024 European Parliament and U.S. Presidential Elections. Crawlers performed identical queries across locations with varying political leanings, collecting results for analysis. Our findings reveal that SEs and LLMs disproportionately prioritize right-leaning political entities and issues. Ongoing analysis seeks to determine whether this bias reflects external factors or is exacerbated by the platforms themselves.

Algorithms can influence individual users’ attitudes by curating their online media diet, but they also play an important role in incentivizing the creation of content in the first place, by giving certain kinds of content an advantage in gaining popularity in the online attention economy. The present research aims to disentangle these mechanisms of algorithmic influence, through a unique experimental paradigm that uses an open-source social media platform, Mastodon, as a “lab in the cloud.” Specifically, we run multiple Mastodon servers in parallel, populate these servers with research participants, and experimentally intervene in server-level algorithmic ranking weights, to estimate effects on server-level discourse outcomes. Using a novel algorithmic ranking system that we built for this experimental infrastructure, we conduct a large-scale online field experiment to investigate how algorithms shape the popularity and production of political content online, as well as users’ political attitudes, affective polarization, offline mobilization, and current events knowledge. Our analyses have important implications both for pro-democratic depolarization efforts, and also for online discourse in authoritarian contexts.","William Small Schulz, Tiziano Piccardi, Farnaz Jahanbakhsh, Michael S.

Chatbots utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, with their rapid adoption, introduce a new paradigm — serving as both information providers and potential gateways. Therefore, the health of the open web today depends on one open question: Are LLM-based chatbots ‘selfish’ in terms of user retention or ‘giving’ (referring users to external websites)? We posit that, as opposed to traditional search engines (before the introduction of LLMs), chatbots follow social media platforms in ‘selfishness’, discouraging engagement with external links to retain user engagement within the interaction with the chatbot, since the value proposition of LLM-based chatbots is to distill the open web, not point people to it. In this sense, chatbots might be ‘parasitic’ — reliant on the open web for their training and abilities to generate content, but gatekeeping and limiting access to the same open web. To this end, the primary research question we investigate in this work is RQ: How do these chatbots influence users' propensity to explore external websites? We will evaluate how chatbots compare to traditional search engines and social media platforms in terms of retention of users and duration of engagement. We will also analyze the content generated by chatbots to understand the contexts in which users are exposed to external websites. Further, we will compare search pages with and without LLM-generated summaries on Google to study if the propensity of search engines to direct users to external websites is also being affected. Since different users might interact with chatbots differently, we will also study the role of demographic factors such as age, gender, partisanship, and education in external website referrals (for example, do users with higher formal education levels click on external links generated by chatbots at a higher rate?). Our study will involve comprehensive analyses of how different user groups seek information and get exposed to information through LLM-based chatbots.","Pranav Goel, Kai-Cheng Yang, David Lazer",Vingen 3+4,Online Platforms & Algorithms I,4,,343

This paper explores the potential risks these applications pose to the democratic process when targeted by adversarial entities. In particular, we expose 11 manipulation strategies and measure their impact using data from Switzerland’s primary VAA, Smartvote, collected during the last two national elections. We find that altering application parameters - such as the matching method - can shift a party’s recommendation frequency by up to 105\%. Cherry-picking questionnaire items can increase party recommendation frequency by over 261\%, while subtle changes to parties’ or candidates’ responses can lead to a 248\% increase. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose adversarial robustness properties VAAs should satisfy, introduce empirical metrics for assessing the resilience of various matching methods, and suggest possible avenues for research toward mitigating the effect of manipulation. Our framework is key to ensuring secure and reliable AI-based VAAs poised to emerge in the near future.","Frédéric Berdoz, Dustin Brunner, Yann Vonlanthen, Roger Wattenhofer",Vingen 3+4,Online Platforms & Algorithms I,5,,222

We introduce a synthetic network model that integrates preferential attachment, triadic closure, and choice homophily, then ex- tend it with various link recommenders, including heuristics and graph neural net- works (GNNs). Our findings show that while simple contagions exhibit relatively modest shifts under most recommenders, complex contagions are highly sensitive to clustering- and homophily-based recommendations, thriving at moderate rec- ommendation strengths but sharply diminishing under excessive recommendation strength. These results underscore the nuanced interplay between network struc- ture, recommendation strength, and contagion dynamics, highlighting the impor- tance of incorporating social contagions into the design of link recommendation algorithms","Björn Komander, Jesus Cerquides, Jeffrey Chan, Azadeh Alavi",Vingen 3+4,Online Platforms & Algorithms I,6,,987

Exploring Political Bias in YouTube Recommendation System,"YouTube is the most widely used social media platform globally, with 83% of Americans (Gottfried, 2024) and 868.4 million users worldwide (Statista, 2024). With its rapid rise in popularity, there is growing concern about the platform's potential to radicalize users through algorithmic recommendations. For example, its algorithmic system recommends ideologically like-minded or extreme content to users, potentially leading them down to rabbit holes (Bryant, 2020; Haroon et al., 2023). While extensive research has examined the ideological congeniality (pro- or counter-attitudinal) of recommended YouTube videos, little is known about the specific types of content within these recommendations. To address this gap, this study explores the types of pro-attitudinal content recommended by YouTube based on the framework of group identity. Specifically, we differentiate pro-attitudinal content into two types: in-group favoritism and out-group hostility. We rely on YouTube audit data from simulated user profiles, referred to as 'sock puppets' developed by Haroon et al. (2023). A total of 100,000 sock puppets were classified into five ideological groups: Far Left, Left, Center, Right, and Far Right. From October 2021 to May 2022, these sock puppets retrieved 5,411,122 videos from homepage recommendations and 16,632,184 videos from up-next recommendations. To capture political content, we filtered videos that mentioned political elites by name or included specific political keywords such as 'GOP,' 'Dem,' and 'Rep.' Additionally, we restricted the analysis to recommended videos from news channels, excluding those from non-news sources. We then identify whether each sock puppet was recommended videos favorable to its in-group or out-group, based on the alignment between its political ideology and the content of the videos. Specifically, we categorized recommended video content as positive, negative, or neutral toward Republicans or Democrats. For the video content classification, we leverage a large language model, OpenAI’s GPT-4o. Our preliminary analysis using a small sample of 5,026 recommendation videos for Far Left sock puppets and 4,974 for Far Right sock puppets shows that out-group hostility in YouTube recommendations is approximately four times greater than in-group favoritism. We also observed significant differences in recommendation patterns within pro-attitudinal content. Far Right users were recommended twice as many out-group hostile videos as Far Left users, whereas Far Left users received more videos favoring their in-group. These findings suggest that YouTube's recommendation algorithm may employ different strategies for engaging users based on group identity, favoring in-group dynamics for Far Left users while attacking out-group dynamics for Far Right users. In our main analysis, we will extend the dataset to include the full sample of recommended videos. Furthermore, we will explore whether this pattern is influenced by YouTube news channels as the supply side. We will systematically examine whether the news channels produce a bias toward one political stance over another. To conclude, this study has the potential to demonstrate how artificial intelligence shapes information consumption through social media algorithms.","Claire Wonjeong jo, Xudong Yu, Magdalena Wojcieszak",Vingen 3+4,Online Platforms & Algorithms II,1,,345

Auditing YouTube Recommendation Algorithms from a Longitudinal Perspective,"Background and Previous Research: As a primary news source for over 200 million U.S. users (Statista, 2024), YouTube’s recommendation system drives 70% of content exposure (Pew Research Center, 2020). Concerns persist that its algorithm reduces information diversity (Roth et al., 2020), amplifies polarization (Roose, 2019), or exhibits systematic biases. Scholars debate whether YouTube’s algorithm reflects systematic biases (e.g., favoring specific partisan content) or congeniality (reinforcing users’ preferences). Systematic bias arguments are based on the supply-demand perspective of platform design (Munger & Phillips, 2022), and empirical studies showing disproportionate amplification of either left-wing (e.g. Ibrahim et al., 2023) or right-wing channels (e.g. Kaiser & Rauchfleisch, 2020). Conversely, congeniality theories emphasize “filter bubbles,” where conservatives receive right-leaning content and liberals left-leaning content (e.g. Haroon et al., 2023). However, longitudinal analyses are scarce, and prior work overlooks event-driven algorithmic shifts. Our study aims to bridge these gaps . Based on discussions above, this paper aims to address the following research questions: RQ1: Does the YouTube recommendation algorithm exhibit systematic ideological bias by consistently promoting left- or right-leaning content regardless of users’ own ideological orientations, or does it provide recommendations that align with users’ political preferences? RQ2: Does the YouTube recommendation algorithm adapt its recommendation patterns over time, particularly in response to significant socio-political events? Dataset and Methods: Based on previous research by Haroon et al. (2023), our dataset includes 229,982 sock puppets across five ideologies, simulating users with distinct ideological leanings. Each puppet watched 100 ideologically labeled videos (30 seconds each) to establish viewing histories. Recommendations from YouTube’s homepage and up-next page were collected on a daily basis, in two separated phases due to computing resource limitations (see the descriptive statistics of the dataset in Table 1). We quantify the political leanings of recommendation results on video level and channel level by referring to existing datasets (Haroon et al., 2023, Wojcieszak et al., 2024). We calculate the daily average slant scores across different sock puppet groups to track the variation of algorithms. Then we conducted the Interrupted Time Series Analysis to test the changes over pre-identified major social political events statistically. Results: Preliminary findings demonstrate algorithmic congeniality: YouTube’s recommendations align with users’ ideological preferences, particularly on the homepage. Aggregated ideological scores across sock puppet groups (Figures 1a and 1b) reveal that far-right puppets received predominantly right-leaning content, while far-left puppets saw left-leaning suggestions, with statistically significant differences among all five ideological groups. Systematic fluctuations emerged in temporal analyses at both video and channel levels (Figures 2a and 2b), showing shifts in recommendation patterns independent of puppet ideologies. To further investigate whether the algorithm would change the mechanism as responses to major socio political news, we are conducting Interrupted Time Series Analyses on 10 major socio political events, with a 7 day window size. While analysis is ongoing, initial results suggest measurable algorithmic responsiveness to events with broad societal impact, underscoring the interplay between external contexts and recommendation mechanics.","Miner Ye, Magdalena Wojcieszak, Muhammad Haroon",Vingen 3+4,Online Platforms & Algorithms II,2,,406

These algorithms, while proprietary and opaque, tend to include user-specific and platform-specifc components. Beyond initial exposure, users exercise their agency in choosing a particular news article to engage with by clicking on the link seen in search results or on a particular social media feed. Across many different platforms such as Google search, Bing search, Google news, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter/X, and ChatGPT, our work studies two important dimensions of online news consumption patterns: the gap between exposure to and engagement with news sites (within specific platforms), and differences across platforms that mediate news exposure and engagement. Specifically, we study three research questions. First, within each specific platform, RQ1: What is the difference in the partisan lean of news sources and the proportion of unreliable news that partisan users get exposed to versus choose to engage with on or through a specific platform? To understand the role of specific platforms in exposing users to certain types of news environment, we study RQ2: Across search engine and different social media platforms, which platform or platforms tend to expose users to higher amounts of partisan news segregation and unreliable news? Finally, we examine news visits rooted in different platforms as the source (engagement) to study: RQ3: Across different platforms, which platform or platforms tend to be the source of higher user engagement with partisan and unreliable news (after controlling for exposure)? All browsing activity and news visits (regardless of source) help serve as a baseline.

This study focuses on one prominent data collection approach, web scraping, and more specifically, its application in the growing field of research relying on web browsing data. We investigate discrepancies between content obtained directly during user interaction with a website (in-situ) and content scraped using the URLs of participants’ logged visits (ex-situ) with various time delays (0, 30, 60, and 90 days). We find substantial disparities between the methodologies, uncovering that errors are not uniformly distributed across news categories regardless of classification method (domain, URL, or content analysis). These biases compromise the precision of measurements used in existing literature. The ex-situ collection environment is the primary source of the discrepancies (~33.8%), while the time delays in the scraping process play a smaller role (adding ~6.5 percentage points in 90 days). Our research emphasizes the need for data collection methods that capture web content directly in the user's environment. However, acknowledging its complexities, we further explore strategies to mitigate biases in web-scraped browsing histories, offering recommendations for researchers who rely on this method and laying the groundwork for developing error-correction frameworks.","Roberto Ulloa, Frank Mangold, Felix Schmidt, Judith Gilsbach, Sebastian Stier",Vingen 3+4,Online Platforms & Algorithms II,6,,151

The dataset has been used in several studies to analyze the relationship between social media engagement and societal issues such as misinformation, polarization, and the quality of consumed news. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the engagement with popular news domains, covering four years from January 2017 to December 2020, with a focus on user engagement metrics related to news URLs in the U.S. By incorporating the ideological alignment and quality of news sources, along with users' political preferences, we construct weighted averages of ideology and quality of news consumption for liberal, conservative, and moderate audiences. This allows us to track the evolution of (i) the ideological gap in news consumption between liberals and conservatives and (ii) the average quality of each group's news consumption. We identify two major shifts in trends, each tied to engagement changes. In both, the ideological gap widens and news quality declines. However, engagement rises in the first shift but falls in the second. Finally, we contextualize these trends by linking them to two major Facebook News Feed updates. Our findings provide empirical evidence to better understand user behavior, polarization, and misinformation during the period covered by the dataset.","Emma Fraxanet, Andreas Kaltenbrunner, Fabrizio Germano, Vicenç Gomez",Concert hall,Misinformation,1,,439

Although past research has focused on echo chambers, emerging evidence suggests that exposure to elites and general political content may be more consequential. In this study, we conducted a pre-registered field experiment following the 2024 U.S. Presidential election. A total of 1,595 participants were recruited via Cloud Research to use a custom client for X (formerly Twitter), which maintained core functionalities while allowing experimental manipulation of timelines. Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: elite-muting, keyword-and-elite muting, a demetricated placebo (with engagement metrics hidden), or an unaltered control. Over four weeks, we measured affective polarization, social identity, and misinformation susceptibility through pre- and post-surveys, while tracking app usage for compliance. Results reveal that reducing exposure to political elites and broader political content significantly decreases affective polarization and misinformation vulnerability. In particular, the keyword-and-elite muting condition yielded the most pronounced effects, suggesting that limiting elite-driven messaging can reduce the reinforcement of partisan identities and mitigate the spread of misinformation. Unlike strategies focused solely on dismantling echo chambers, our findings emphasize that the broader exposure to political information—especially from influential elites—is a critical driver of both polarization and misinformation susceptibility. This work highlights the need for social media platforms to address the pervasive influence of elite messaging in order to foster healthier political discourse.","Kokil Jaidka, Subhayan Mukerjee, Yphtach Lelkes",Concert hall,Misinformation,2,,284

This issue may have led readers to misinterpret the results of that study and to conclude that the Facebook news feed algorithm used outside of the study period mitigates political misinformation as compared to reverse chronological feed. In this paper, we demonstrate that during the period of these emergency measures, which significantly overlapped with the Guess et al. experiment, the fraction of untrustworthy news views on Facebook dropped by 24%.

This study audits Google RIS to examine the types of content it retrieves when verifying visual misinformation and how these results change over time. Using a dataset of 95 misleading images sourced from fact-checking websites, we submitted them to Google RIS and collected 34,486 links and metadata. Content analysis reveals that a substantial portion of retrieved content is distracting information irrelevant to the searched images and events. Misinformation is frequently repeated, while debunking content appears less often. The effectiveness of Google RIS varies by misinformation type and topic: out-of-context misinformation yields the least debunking content compared to others, and political misinformation receives more debunking content than non-political misinformation. Mixed-effects logistic regression confirms these patterns. Additionally, google RIS has also shown a decline in distracting content and an increase in debunking results over time. This study expands research on search engines as fact-checking tools by examining their effectiveness in addressing visual misinformation. It challenges prior assumptions about RIS’s ability to reliably trace original image context and offers insights into how its performance evolves over time.","Cong LIN, YIFEI CHEN, Jiangyue Chen, Cuihua Shen, Yilang Peng, Yingdan Lu",Concert hall,Misinformation,4,,502

Existing content moderation and reputation systems have proven insufficient in addressing the root incentives that drive false advertising. This paper introduces a novel market-based mechanism, “truth warrants” that allows online advertisers to guarantee the accuracy of their claims, and presents buyers with the ability to seek recourse when they are misled. Through a series of controlled online experiments in a two-sided digital marketplace, we demonstrate that introducing self-certification for advertisements reduces the prevalence of misleading ads by penalizing cheating advertisers that make false claims, and promotes accountability among online advertisers, without affecting the profits or sales of honest advertisers. This research contributes to market design, human-computer interaction, and social computing, offering an empirically validated intervention with implications for platform governance and commercial misinformation.","Swapneel S Mehta, Aaron D Nichols, Nina.

This study investigates whether dialogues with AI about AI-generated images and associated news statements can increase human discernment abilities and foster short-term learning in detecting misinformation. We conduct a study with 80 participants who engage in structured dialogues with an AI system about news headline-image pairs, generating 1,310 human-AI dialogue exchanges. Results show that AI interaction significantly boosts participants' accuracy in identifying real versus fake news content from approximately 60% to 90% (p<0.001). However, these improvements do not persist when participants are presented with new, unseen image-statement pairs without AI assistance, with accuracy returning to baseline levels (~60%, p=0.88). These findings suggest that while AI systems can effectively change immediate beliefs about specific content through persuasive dialogue, they may not produce lasting improvements that transfer to novel examples, highlighting the need for developing more effective interventions that promote durable learning outcomes.","Anku Rani, Valdemar Danry, Andrew Lippman, Patricia Maes",Concert hall,Misinformation,6,,613

Bridging social choice and machine learning literature, we assess this algorithm’s impact on minority viewpoints and the incentives it creates for users to misrepresent their perspectives. We develop a theoretical and simulation-based framework to analyze how Birdwatch’s matrix-factorization-based aggregation mechanism interacts with different population structures. Our results indicate that population shifts and model choices significantly influence quality estimation from community feedback. Minority perspectives can be systematically disadvantaged, potentially exacerbating viewpoint imbalances. Moreover, users have strategic incentives to feign extreme ideological positions, amplifying polarization rather than mitigating it. Model selection, particularly regularization, plays a critical role in moderating these effects—switching from $L_2$ to $L_1$ regularization can mitigate the effects above. These findings highlight the importance of an interdisciplinary perspective at the intersection of computational social choice, mechanism design, and ML fairness to understand how model-driven community-based mechanisms create both estimates and strategic incentives.","David Gamba, Seura Ha, Daniel Romero, Grant Schoenebeck",Vingen 8,Communication & Cooperation I,1,,825

We study a large corpus of online multiplayer public goods games, and we measure 63 features capturing various theories about the role of communication in economic games. We find that the mere existence of a communication channel facilitates higher rates of contribution, even when it is not in use.

In today’s digital landscape, this discourse is no longer limited to content produced by humans—AI-generated content, particularly those produced by Large Language Models (LLMs), is becoming increasingly prevalent. Despite their growing presence, the impact of LLMs on opinion formation and change remains largely unknown. *What role do LLMs play in public discourse, particularly in shaping and changing opinions?* We investigate the persuasive capabilities of LLMs through the lens of Jürgen Habermas’ Communicative Action Theory, examining whether these models express illocutionary intents (i.e., pragmatic meanings of language such as conveying knowledge, trust, or similarity) comparably to humans. In particular, we simulate an online discussion between an opinion holder and an LLM using conversations from the persuasive subreddit ChangeMyView. We then compare the odds of illocutionary intents in human-written opinion-changing counter-arguments and LLM-generated ones. Our findings show that LLMs are capable of engaging in *nuanced communicative actions*, potentially shaping human opinions in ways not yet fully understood. Potentially, LLM alignment training not only reinforces existing human biases but also makes individuals more susceptible to AI-driven influence on critical issues such as politics, social justice, and the environment. Given these concerns, we call for further research into the impact of alignment training on public discourse and opinion formation.","Esra Dönmez, Agnieszka Falenska",Vingen 8,Communication & Cooperation I,3,,353

While a variety of persuasive strategies have been shown to increase charitable donations to effective charities, their success depends heavily on individual differences. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a powerful solution to this problem by dynamically personalizing persuasive strategies to each individual. In a large-scale, pre-registered experiment, we tested whether personalized LLM conversations could increase donations to the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF), rated one of the world’s most effective charities. Participants allocated $1 between their favorite charity and AMF after being assigned to one of three conditions: (1) a personalized persuasive LLM conversation, (2) a static LLM-generated persuasive message, and (3) a control conversation. Personalized LLM conversations significantly increased donations to AMF by 46.6%, outperforming the static message condition (28.7% increase), while the control condition showed no significant change. Personalized LLMs also shifted moral attitudes about charitable giving. Our findings highlight the potential of AI-driven personalization to enhance effective giving and provide new insights into the psychology of charitable persuasion.

What shapes the trajectory of conflictual conversations? Here, we focus on conversational receptiveness—the use of language to behaviorally demonstrate one’s thoughtful engagement with opposing views—and its transmission between disagreeing parties in dialogue. We use a multidisciplinary and multimethod approach (collective N = 17,184) to test whether and how conversational receptiveness shapes disagreeing counterpart behavior and evaluations of each other, thereby improving conflict outcomes. We first report the development of an updated algorithm for measuring receptiveness in text. Using the updated algorithm, we find that conversational receptiveness enacted by one party predicts receptiveness by the other among students in online class forums (Study 1) and government leaders in the laboratory (Study 2). In pre-registered, well-powered, and replicated experiments, we find that training one individual in this technique also increased its use by a political opponent (Study 3) and that a single use of receptiveness improved interpersonal (and intergroup) evaluations. This transmission is distinct from mimicry or emotion contagion and is driven by a deeper shift in linguistic style, which we term indirect accommodation. Together, we find that conversational receptiveness is effective not only for shifting behavior during a focal disagreement, but also for shifting subsequent interpersonal and intergroup evaluations, providing disagreeing parties with a path around destructive conflict spirals. Broadly, our research emphasizes the importance of studying how linguistic behavior shapes conflict dynamics.","Michael Yeomans, Julia Minson, Hanne Collins, Charles Dorison",Vingen 8,Communication & Cooperation I,5,,649

2025-07-23 14:30:00,2025-07-23 16:00:00,session_presentation,Understanding the Time-to-Persuasion in Multi-Round Discussions,"Persuasion is a fundamental aspect of communication, shaping opinions, decision-making, and behavior across various domains, including politics, marketing, and online discourse. Prior research has extensively explored persuasive strategies such as counterarguments, rhetorical questions, and concessions, demonstrating their effectiveness in influencing attitudes (Selicka, 2024; Musi et al., 2018). Additionally, studies on the cumulative exposure effect suggest that repeated exposure to persuasive messages enhances persuasion but with diminishing returns (Cacioppo & Petty, 1979; Koch & Arendt, 2017). However, while these studies offer valuable insights into persuasion mechanisms, they primarily focus on single-exposure effects or static argument structures rather than the dynamic, interactive nature of persuasion. In online discussions, persuasion is rarely a one-time event; instead, it unfolds over multiple conversational rounds, with participants engaging in iterative exchanges before reaching a conclusion. Despite this, little is known about how the number of conversational rounds affects persuasion success. This study investigated the relationship between the number of conversational rounds and persuasion success in online discussions. While prior research has categorized persuasive argumentation techniques (Egawa et al., 2020) and examined their effectiveness in various contexts, it has not explicitly addressed how the length of a persuasive exchange influences the probability of success. We hypothesize that the likelihood of persuasion success follows a time-dependent pattern influenced by the number of conversational rounds, engagement levels, conversation topic, and argumentative strategies. To test these hypotheses, we employed Cox proportional hazards survival analysis to model the probability of persuasion success over multiple conversational rounds. Survival analysis is well-suited for this task, as it allows us to estimate the likelihood of persuasion occurring at each conversational round while accounting for censoring (cases where persuasion may not have been achieved within the observed interaction window). Our study analyzed a large corpus of online persuasive discussions from subreddit /r/ChangeMyView, estimating conversation topics and key argumentative strategies along with the engagement metrics to determine their effects on persuasion success. Model 1 showed that higher engagement (operationalized as the number of delta threads and engaged threads) significantly increases the hazard of persuasion occurring sooner, meaning persuasion is more likely to happen earlier in a conversation. In contrast, a greater maximum number of turns in engaged threads is associated with a lower hazard, suggesting that longer discussions delay or reduce the probability of persuasion success at any given round. Model 2 included topics, and we found that topic effects on persuasion timing are weak overall. While discussions on foreign policies and gun control issues show a lower hazard, indicating that persuasion takes longer or is less likely to occur in these discussions, most other topics do not exhibit significant effects. This suggests that the difficulty of persuading someone may be topic-dependent, but topic effects alone do not strongly dictate the timing of persuasion success. Model 3 examined the effect of argumentative strategies. Specific techniques significantly impact how quickly persuasion occurs. The use of concessions, rebuttals, and emotional appeals (both positive and negative) increases the hazard of persuasion, meaning that these strategies accelerate the likelihood of persuasion success within fewer conversational rounds. Concessions have the strongest effect, suggesting that acknowledging opposing viewpoints can expedite persuasion by building credibility and fostering agreement. The improvement in model concordance from 0.782 in Model 1 to 0.824 in Model 3 indicates that incorporating argumentative strategies enhances the model’s predictive accuracy in estimating when persuasion is likely to occur. These results highlight the dynamic nature of persuasion, demonstrating that engagement, argumentation strategies, and discussion topics collectively shape when persuasion is achieved in an ongoing conversation.","Wanting Wang, Haoran Shi",Vingen 8,Communication & Cooperation II,1,,1050

Studies have shown that VAAs enhance political knowledge [6, 13], increase political engagement, and boost voting intention [13, 8]. However, despite their popularity, traditional VAAs face significant challenges that limit their effectiveness in fostering informed democratic participation. These challenges include comprehension problems [3] due to the use of complex terminology, a skewed adoption towards young, educated, and politically engaged users [10, 1, 7, 12], and a rigid presentation of policy statements that does not cater to individual voters’ curiosity and informational needs. To address these limitations, prior research has suggested integrating explainer chatbots into VAAs to address comprehension challenges [4, 11]. Yet an LLM-based conversational chatbot’s potential as a tool for tailored discussion and deliberate decision-making [9, 2] remains untapped. In this study, we investigate (1) how an LLM-based chatbot can address the limitations of traditional VAAs, (2) what additional value a conversational interface can bring to voters, and (3) what obstacles to trusted utilization of VAA chatbots need to be overcome. We deployed a prototype VAA chatbot (Figure 1) that allowed users to engage in two ways with electoral information: a ChatGPT-like interaction involving freeform questions and responses, and a structured survey format mimicking traditional VAAs with policy statements and stance selection. A total of 331 participants interacted with the chatbot in our user study prior to the 2024 European Parliament Election in Germany and completed a survey. We followed up with 10 participants with in-depth interviews to gather qualitative insights. Our exploratory mixed-methods approach prioritized understanding users’ informational needs and value of such tools over refining specific UI elements or model parameters, ensuring that findings contribute broadly to future chatbot design for civic education. Our study revealed several key findings: First, participants found the chatbot notably more accessible than traditional VAAs. The ability to clarify complex political terms on demand and provide tailored explanations lowered barriers to engagement, making political information more digestible. The chatbot’s flexibility in responding to individuals’ curiosity was frequently cited as a strength, as it allowed users to navigate political topics at their own pace and according to their interests. Secondly, beyond merely providing voting advice, the conversational format of the chatbot facilitated curiosity-driven exploration and self-reflection. Users reported that the chatbot encouraged them to think critically about their own opinions, explore different political perspectives, and engage more deeply with policy discussions. The chatbot’s ability to simulate dialogue and present counterarguments contributed to a richer, more deliberative form of voter education compared to traditional VAAs, which often reduce political alignment to a numerical ranking. Thirdly, concerns about trustworthiness and transparency emerged as clear obstacles to user trust. Participants expressed skepticism due to LLMs’ known limitations, particularly their susceptibility to generating incorrect or biased information. While users appreciated the chatbot’s informative nature, many emphasized the importance of verifiable sources and transparency in how responses were generated. The majority of interviewees explicitly stated that they would like to see references accompanying the chatbot’s claims to enhance credibility. Additionally, some users worried that the chatbot might only reinforce their personal pre-existing opinions rather than challenge perspectives, raising questions about how such tools should be designed to promote balanced and objective discourse. Our findings suggest that LLM-based VAA chatbots hold significant potential for expanding the reach and effectiveness of digital civic education by making political information more accessible, engaging, and interactive. However, to build justified user trust [5], future designs must prioritize transparency, accountability, and neutrality. We propose several design recommendations, including the integration of source traceability, third-party audits, and mechanisms that actively encourage critical thinking rather than passive agreement. We hope our work inspires further exploration in designing trusted LLM-based systems that empower citizens to better understand their political landscape, critically reflect on their opinions, and actively engage as an informed stakeholder in democratic processes.","Jianlong Zhu, Manon Lilott Kempermann, Vikram Kamath Cannanure, Alexander Hartland, Giuseppe Carteny, Rosa M.

In this study, we leverage embeddings, large language models, and lexicon-based methods to quantify and categorize facilitator styles and participant roles in small-group conversations. Using the Fora Corpus, which comprises 262 facilitated conversations (39,911 speaker turns, with 25% manually annotated for personal storytelling and experiences), we extend existing annotations via few-shot prompting and incorporate phatic speech as a distinguishing feature between social talk and substantive contributions. Our approach establishes a taxonomy of facilitator styles by integrating psycholinguistic traits, constructive communication metrics, and speech act analysis. We identify two distinct styles: a managerial approach - characterized by a focus on balancing turn-taking - and an interlocutor approach that emphasizes direct engagement with participants. Notably, the managerial style correlates with a statistically significant increase in turn-taking equity and a higher personal sharing ratio. Further analysis reveals emergent participant roles, including Storytellers, Socializers, and Debaters, each contributing uniquely to the dynamics of dialogue. These findings offer new insights into the interplay between facilitator style, conversational structure, and participant behavior, advancing the computational study of facilitated dialogue and providing a robust basis for future research.","Paul Fromm, Michael A.

Prior work has shown that LLMs can display dialect bias, which occurs when they produce harmful responses when prompted with text written in minoritized dialects. However, whether and how this bias propagates to systems built on top of LLMs, such as chatbots, is still unclear. To address this, we present a framework for auditing LLM-based chatbots for dialect bias by measuring the extent to which they produce quality-of-service harms, which occur when systems do not work equally well for different people. The framework consists of five steps: target identification, prompt collection, prompt perturbation, response collection, and disaggregated evaluation. The framework has several key characteristics that make it useful in practice. First, by leveraging dynamically generated instead of pre-existing text, our framework enables testing over any dialect, facilitates multi-turn conversations, and represents how users are likely to interact with chatbots in the real world. Second, by measuring quality-of-service harms, our framework aligns audit results with the real-world outcomes of chatbot use and also calls attention to the often under-measured quality of AI functionality. Third, our framework requires only query access to an LLM-based chatbot, meaning that it can be leveraged equally effectively by internal auditors, external auditors, and even individual users in order to promote accountability. We present a case study of our framework applied to Amazon Rufus, a widely-used LLM-based chatbot in the customer service domain. We find that Rufus is more likely to produce low-quality responses when prompted in minoritized dialects, and that this effect is exacerbated by the presence of typos in the prompt.","Emma Harvey, Rene F Kizilcec, Allison Koenecke",Vingen 8,Communication & Cooperation II,4,,115

The current paper examines whether a structural aspect of disagreement–the communication medium by which it occurs–can enhance constructive outcomes. Across nine randomized experiments (n=1,576 conversation partners and 1,432 observers who rated the conversations) we show that spoken conversations elicit higher understanding, lower experienced conflict, more favorable impressions of one’s counterpart, and more attitude alignment compared to written conversations. At least one reason for this result is that, in speech, people communicate with greater receptiveness (i.e., linguistic cues that demonstrate listening and intellectual humility), which mediates the effect of medium on constructive outcomes. However, conversation medium also moderates the effect of receptiveness: linguistic receptiveness is a significantly better predictor of constructive disagreement for written than spoken conversations, suggesting people use receptive language less often in the very context (i.e., writing) when it is most effective. Furthermore, people mis-estimate how the medium affects their conversations, incorrectly predicting that spoken conversations will be less constructive than written ones. If people are willing to engage in it, spoken conversation is a promising means for facilitating constructive disagreement.","Burint Bevis, Juliana Schroeder, Michael Yeomans",Vingen 8,Communication & Cooperation II,5,,633

Such conflicts can have a significant impact on team performance and cohesion. Identifying and mitigating conflicts in team interactions is crucial to fostering productive activities and relationships. Prior conflict detection methods have relied mainly on classical machine learning models, focusing primarily on interpersonal (i.e., relationship) conflicts alone. However, conflicts are more varied, including not only interpersonal issues but also task conflicts that stem from differing perspectives or approaches towards the work itself. Detecting the distinct conflict types is crucial since they have differential impacts on team performance. In this research, we first develop a novel, synthetic team conflict dataset (SWD) designed to distinguish between these conflict types and their varying levels. We propose a team conflict detection approach that utilizes multi-feature embeddings (MFemb), incorporating structural (dialogue acts and entrainment) and affective (sentiment and emotion) features to capture nuanced states in conversations. A range of computational models are proposed, including MFemb-enhanced classical models (Logistic Regression, SVM and Random Forest), MFemb-enhanced language models (BERT and RoBERTa) and large language models (GPT-4o and Gemini 1.0 Pro). Experiments on four datasets (including ours) demonstrate the superior performance of our approach, with F1 scores of up to 0.95 for conflict type and 0.86 for conflict intensity, significantly improving upon the baselines. This sets a new benchmark in the field and offers novel insights into the detection and mitigation of team conflicts.","Astha Verma, Pratyush Yadav, atreyi",Vingen 8,Communication & Cooperation II,6,,135

Using Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting (AIPW) to estimate the average treatment effect, results indicate that meeting a partner online consistently leads to a 10-30% lower likelihood of marriage and having biological children across sampled countries. However, online dating does not significantly impact relationship satisfaction or the likelihood of considering a breakup. AIPW and multinomial models further reveal that meeting the partner through online dating increases both education hypergyny and hypogyny, and that the effect on nativity heterogamy is mostly driven by hypergyny rather than hypogyny. In contrast, its effect on age heterogamy remains limited. To explore treatment effect heterogeneity, Causal Forests are applied, estimating individual treatment effects (ITE) across demographic groups. Results provide evidence for all three key gradients, namely an education gradient, nativity gradient, and cohort gradient. The varying characteristics of the education and nativity gradients in online dating’s effects likely reflect how strongly education and nativity structure social and romantic opportunities in different countries. The cohort gradient reveals that later-born cohorts experience weaker negative effects on marriage and fertility, reflecting shifting social norms and life course expectations. These findings highlight how online dating reshapes relationship trajectories in stratified ways, reinforcing existing social structures while expanding opportunities for diverse partnerships. Methodologically, this study advances causal inference in partner selection research by leveraging AIPW and Causal Forests, offering a fine-grained, cross-national perspective on contemporary dating and family formation.",Zerui Tian,Vingen 1+2,Digital Behavior,1,,189

The aim of the app is both to fuel academic research on topics ranging from chemistry and compatibility to hierarchies of desirability, and also develop and test new features that help people searching for connections more effectively figure out what they want from relationships and how to get it. Several practical factors motivated our team to create Revel: 1. Most online activity data is locked up in private companies and inaccessible for social research; access is a major barrier for scientific progress. 2. Even if companies did make data more widely available, their apps are designed to maximize user engagement, not answer basic and applied research questions. 3. Ultimately, we wanted to have the freedom to develop and test new app features; to use the science to guide the app and the app to guide the science. The app is embedded within an IRB-approved research study and will initially be available only to registered students at a single university. Revel differs from more traditional dating apps in its focal population of young adults who are still learning about who they are and what they want; its detailed surveys on users' backgrounds, psychological profiles, preferences, and experiences; and finally in a number of features that allow us to conduct information experiments within the app. In addition to collecting online behavioral data, we are launching a “First Date” study where people have their first dates in a restaurant lab; we then track how their rhythms and interactions online translate into offline spaces. In the presentation, I will first discuss our motivations for creating Revel---both practical and scientific. I will discuss the process of creating the app and how we designed some of its more unique features. I will then describe some of the challenges we encountered in building the app and what its short to medium term future looks like. I will also present some initial findings from our beta testing pool about how students are using the app. I will close with ideas for how to promote more science-based nonprofit apps and how to lower the barriers to developing them.",Elizabeth E.

Our goal is to explore commonalities and differences in topics discussed in social media profiles, across Left- and Right-wing user groups, within and across EU countries. Through a novel approach we map how identity-related discourse varies by country and political orientation, revealing how group identity is expressed within the EU. We find that topics related to democracy, national way of life, and decentralization emerge as particularly divisive, showing considerable variation both within and between EU countries. A subset of topics, which includes education, environmentalism, sustainability, equality, freedom & human rights, and traditional morality, among others, clearly differentiate Left- from Right-leaning user groups. These partisan topics are relevant as they could be leveraged for mobilizing ideological groups and highlight Left-Right identitarian differences at the EU level. Finally, we show that our Left-Right identity similarity metrics reflect aspects of real-world political fragmentation, which are closely aligned to the perceptions of political conflict intensity by country, as measured by the 2022 PEW survey.","Carlo Romano Marcello Alessandro Santagiustina, Jean-Philippe Cointet, Pedro Ramaciotti Morales",Vingen 1+2,Digital Behavior,3,,710

Researchers take the assumption that citizens engage with the campaign, especially via news coverage, and learn about the most important events and issues. However, due to a lack of content data and imprecise self-reported measures of media use, it has so far been difficult to directly link exposure with measures of political learning. In this paper, we use linked panel surveys and web tracking data collected from more than 700 study participants during the 2021 German federal election. In two survey waves, we implemented a series of political statements that participants had to rate as true or false. Results from a multiverse analysis that varies different online news content measures and other regression specifications show that online political news exposure is a consistently positive predictor of political learning, in contrast to more generic exposure measures. The substantive results demonstrate the value of moving beyond static political knowledge questions when aiming to measure political learning in dynamic media environments. Methodologically, the paper shows that linking fine-grained measures of digital behavior with surveys can provide new answers to established social science research questions.","Sebastian Stier, Felix Schmidt",Vingen 1+2,Digital Behavior,4,,845

It is difficult to grasp an overview of information in these documents by reading each document. Thus, a method for topic extraction, that is, clustering many documents into topics, is needed. Previous studies only utilize natural language processing for topic extraction; therefore, they cannot detect the trends of topics and distinguish the direct correlation between keywords among topics. To overcome this difficulty, this paper proposes a novel method for topic extraction utilizing both semantic and trend features to explore the relationship between Internet users’ search and news in social events. Specifically, we use graphical lasso-guided iterative principal component analysis (GLIPCA) for trend clustering and use Affinity Propagation to semantically cluster word embedding of keywords (Word2Vec/ SentenceBERT) into topics. Our method can detect trends by time-series signal processing and remove the indirect correlation between keywords that support in clarifying the actual relationship between topics. To validate the effectiveness of proposed methods, we compare our method with other methods by F-score, ARI, and AMI. As a result, our method outperforms with other methods. The proposed method provides insights into exploring information from a keyword perspective, which is especially useful for detecting important trends in information on the Internet.","Hoan Huu Le, Ryosuke Harakawa, iwahashi",Vingen 1+2,Digital Behavior,5,,259

We examine user characteristics that predict usage of the AI-powered conversational agent ChatGPT. We combine behavioral and survey data in a web tracked sample of N = 1376 German citizens to investigate differences in ChatGPT activity (usage, visits, and adoption) during the first 11 months from the launch of the service (November 30, 2022). Guided by a model of technology acceptance (UTAUT-2), we examine the role of socio-demographics commonly associated with the digital divide in ChatGPT activity and explore further socio-political attributes identified via stability selection in Lasso regressions. We confirm that lower age and higher education affect ChatGPT usage, but do not find that gender or income do. We find full-time employment and more children to be barriers to ChatGPT activity. Using a variety of social media was positively associated with ChatGPT activity. In terms of political variables, political knowledge and political self-efficacy as well as some political behaviors such as voting, debating political issues online and offline and political action online were all associated with ChatGPT activity, with online political debating and political self-efficacy negatively so. Finally, need for cognition and communication skills such as writing, attending meetings, or giving presentations, were also associated with ChatGPT engagement, though chairing/organizing meetings was negatively associated. Our research informs efforts to address digital disparities and promote digital literacy among underserved populations by presenting implications, recommendations, and discussions on ethical and social issues of our findings.","Roberto Ulloa, Celina Kacperski, Denis Bonnay, Juhi Kulshrestha, Peter Selb, Andreas Spitz",Vingen 1+2,Digital Behavior,6,,158

2025-07-22 11:00:00,2025-07-22 12:30:00,session_presentation,Collective Moral Reasoning in Multi-Agent LLMs,"What happens when artificial agents debate moral dilemmas together? As AI ensembles increasingly assist in ethically complex political and health domains, understanding how large language models (LLMs) reach moral consensus is critical. This study investigates how multi-agent LLMs negotiate moral decisions and explores their potential alignment—or misalignment—with human collective moral reasoning. Understanding collective moral deliberations in LLMs is particularly important in light of recent research identifying trends in LLMs’ judgments. Proprietary LLMs, for example, appear more utilitarian than their open-weight counterparts (Tlaie, 2024): They try to maximize the concrete benefits for the greatest number of people rather than rely on rules for behavior. LLMs frequently favor utilitarian outcomes in ways that might misalign with human medical ethics (Sorin et al., 2024). But the tendencies depend on context, as LLMs tend to respond in a less utilitarian manner to personal (direct) versus impersonal (indirect) harms (Garcia et al., 2024). While these findings provide insights into individual LLM behavior, research has shown that the dynamics of multi-agent discussions can significantly alter AI judgments (Xu et al., 2024). Collective decision-making in humans results in more utilitarian judgments (Keshmirian et al., 2022). It is unclear if the same happens with multi-agent LLM systems. Our experiments address this gap. Building on prior moral (Greene et al., 2014; Keshmirian et al., 2022; Körner et al., 2022) and group decision-making research (Keshmirian et al., 2023; Rokosz et al., 2025; Curşeu et al., 2020), we presented LLM agents with personal dilemmas, impersonal dilemmas, and non-moral controls. We formed groups of 2, 3, or 4 GPT-3.5-Turbo agents, each initialized with an onboarding opinion (1–10 scale) randomized across the agents, with 10 representing complete moral acceptability of a proposed utilitarian action or inaction. To ensure a moderate range of viewpoints without excessive initial polarization, each group’s maximum difference among initial ratings was capped at 5 points. Agents participated in at least three sequential rounds of discussion, where agents could defend their positions and reference or challenge prior arguments. The debate ended when final opinions converged to a separating distance of 1. We tracked changes in utilitarian vs. non-utilitarian moral judgments, as well as the polarization of agent positions. By systematically adjusting group size, interaction rounds, and consensus criteria, we aimed to mimic real-world collective settings while controlling for known biases in multi-agent LLM discussions (Sorin et al., 2024). Our findings indicated that impersonal dilemmas (indirect harm to maximize the benefit for many) elicited a clear shift toward utilitarianism in multi-agent LLM groups, broadly aligning with human groups (Keshmirian et al., 2022). In personal dilemmas involving direct harm, however, LLM groups consistently favored less utilitarian ratings. If the direct harm was caused by an omission, the groups became even less utilitarian in their consensus. This pattern diverges from prior human experiments (see Keshmirian et al., 2022; Rokosz et al., 2025; Curşeu et al., 2020). Prior work shows that multi-agent discussion can create polarization (Wang et al., 2024). To examine this in moral judgments, we tracked changes in LLM responses over time and measured polarization by counting extreme responses (ratings ≤ 2 or ≥ 8) before and after discussion. This allowed us to assess whether agents adopted more extreme stances during deliberation or moved toward moderation. Our analysis showed that personal and impersonal dilemmas both increased the rate of extreme ratings, indicating polarization in moral scenarios compared to non-moral cases where positions tended to be less divergent. Wasserstein Distance analysis confirms the reliability of the observed polarization, showing no significant difference in onboarding distributions (W = 0.0686, KS p = 0.4017, p > 0.05), but a significant difference in reflection distributions (W = 0.8753, KS p < 0.05, p < 1.77e-40). This heightened polarization underscores that the role of moral content in amplifying disagreement (Garrett & Bankert, 2020) extends to AI-driven group discussions. These outcomes expand our understanding of how LLM collectives handle moral problems and where they diverge from human moral norms. Although humans reasoning collectively often become more utilitarian for both direct (Curşeu et al., 2020) and indirect harms (Keshmirian et al., 2022), LLM groups became selectively more utilitarian in indirect harm cases. Moreover, they became more polarized in both personal and impersonal (but not non-moral) scenarios. Our findings raise concerns about how multi-agent LLM systems—already poised to inform policy, healthcare, and judicial decisions—might propose actions that depart from human moral intuitions.","Anita Keshmirian, Razan Baltaji, Hadi Asghari, Babak Hemmatian",Vingen 7,ABMs I,1,,829

We analyze the evolution of the network by examining gender scores assigned to Chirpers based on their posts, using a machine learning algorithm to calculate perceived gender. This approach allows us to track shifts in perceived gender over time and explore how gender influences interactions within the network. To examine gender-based homophily, we calculated correlations based on the gender scores of chirpers who share an edge. The results illustrate a tendency for Chirpers to connect with those who share the same gender or similar gender scores. Additionally, screening the evolution of the network over the 52 weeks reveals complex network dynamics and clustering patterns, as well as the increasing use of masculine language in Chirpers' content over time.","Faezeh Fadaei, Taha Yasseri",Vingen 7,ABMs I,2,,393

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a powerful extension to traditional ABMs due to their strong text generation capabilities, potentially allowing for more realistic, rich, and detailed simulations. However, it is unclear how to evaluate and validate these simulations, particularly since there are persisting questions of algorithmic bias and LLM reliability. Therefore, we conceptualize a validation framework for evaluating LLM simulations. Besides the validity concepts from ABM literature, we also incorporate validity concepts from measurement theory and Computational Social Science. Grounding our framework on several different types of simulations to ensure breadth and comprehensiveness, we present case studies of six simulation studies and the different types of validation required in them. Our framework informs the design of simulation benchmarks as well as documentation and reporting checklists for generative simulation creators.","Indira Sen, Georg Ahnert, Markus Strohmaier, Jana Lasser",Vingen 7,ABMs I,3,,810
2025-07-22 11:00:00,2025-07-22 12:30:00,session_presentation,Higher-order modeling of face-to-face interactions,"Face-to-face contacts lie at the core of an individual's social world. A street encounter with a stranger, discussing with colleagues over coffee, having dinner with family, or hanging out with a group of friends: all of these represent the most fundamental form of social interaction. The recent availability of high-resolution data on individuals' proximity has allowed researchers to uncover how those seemingly random interactions display coherent spatio-temporal characteristics across several social contexts. Specifically, face-to-face interactions show universal features, such as the absence of a characteristic scale for contact duration, the switching between low activity periods and high activity bursts, and a great heterogeneity in interaction behaviors among individuals. The ubiquity of these features has thus posed the crucial challenge of explaining what mechanisms underlie their emergence. Modeling frameworks based on mobile agents proved to be a valuable tool to understand the organization of human face-to-face interactions. In this scenario, agents move erratically in a spatial environment and interactions occur every time they get close together. In addition, contacts between agents can be modulated by more complex mechanisms, including their attractiveness, their activeness and reachability, their pairwise similarity, or belonging to the same social group. This class of models gave useful insights to understand the bursty and small-world behavior of face-to-face interactions, as well as many social phenomena emerging from them, like disease spreading, spatial segregation and echo chamber formation, and structural inequalities. These models, however, are limited as they describe face-to-face interactions only in terms of dyadic relationships between agents. In fact, they adopt a temporal network representation, focusing either on the dynamics of dyadic contacts, i.e., links, or the mesoscopic level of social gatherings, i.e., connected components. However, humans do not only interact in pairs, but regularly engage in groups involving more than two individuals at the same time. Although some recent works have investigated the higher-order nature of face-to-face interactions, current models based on mobile agents either overlook or fail to capture the spatio-temporal features and the dynamical evolution of groups. Here, we bridge this gap by introducing a model in which mobile agents interact with each other by forming groups of different sizes. Each group is characterized by an intrinsic degree of social appeal that we call ``group attractiveness''. Agents passing in the vicinity of a group choose whether to join it based on its attractiveness, while group members decide whether to stay or walk away. We analyze six high-resolution datasets describing the dynamics of contacts between individuals in different social systems. We show how the Group Attractiveness Model (GAM) can reproduce different properties of groups in face-to-face interactions, including their statistics, the correlation in their number, and their temporal duration, which cannot be reproduced by models based on dyadic interactions. Furthermore, differently from low-order approaches, we demonstrate the potential of our model to correctly capture higher-order homophilic patterns not only at the level of pairwise contacts but also at that of group interactions. Our results advance a recent line of research aiming at defining and measuring homophily at the level of group interactions. The superior performance of our model compared to pairwise methods marks the need to adopt higher-order models to investigate groups in face-to-face interactions. Capturing the microscopic dynamics of groups is crucial, as group interactions can dramatically change the collective behavior of complex social systems, leading to super-exponential disease spreading, triggering critical mass effects in social contagion, and boosting the ability of committed minorities to overturn social norms. Given its capability to reproduce different features of the data, we are confident that our model will prove to be beneficial to investigate how groups affect social collective behaviors.","Luca Gallo, Chiara Zappalà, Fariba Karimi, Federico Battiston",Vingen 7,ABMs I,4,,753

In spite of this, classical models of opinion dynamics do not account for how an individual’s beliefs shape and are shaped by a multi-dimensional social identity. We develop a modelling framework that captures this dynamic, by describing the evolution of beliefs in terms of a desire to signal both in-group membership and out-group differentiation, across multiple dimensions of identity. We use this approach, which is based in social identity theory, to study how the number of identity dimensions impacts the distribution of opinions within a population. We show that as the number of identity dimensions reduces, the tendency towards opinion polarisation increases. Furthermore, we show that in extreme cases, this can lead to a ``collapse'' of the Overton window, in which different identity groups adopt increasingly extreme opinions even in the face of sanctions.",Leon Klingborg,Vingen 7,ABMs I,5,,796

Implemented within an agent-based modeling framework, agents learn that adopting items with these features yields reward, and they become more likely to choose similar items in the future, resulting in diffusion patterns that mirror those observed in real-world social networks.","Oromia Sero, Björn Lindström",Vingen 7,ABMs I,6,,396

However, our findings suggest that neither is strictly necessary. We propose an alternative model where unbiased employers use Bayesian sequential decision-making and share experiences to collectively optimize hiring outcomes. While this strategy facilitates rapid learning about the most productive groups, it also unintendedly fosters collective bias when distinguishing among uniformly competent groups. Far from uncovering the truth, these employers overinvest in a few groups of workers without exploring others, producing an uneven labor market despite equivalent potential. This occurs because employers frequently share and integrate each other's information, causing the group to compress individual experiences. This information compression leads to less diverse and less exploratory future decisions. Our evidence comes from a Bayesian multi-agent multi-armed bandit model, simulations with LLM-based generative agents, and human data from a multiplayer online hiring experiment. Our work illustrates how rational collective decisions can inadvertently establish unequal labor market dynamics, laying the groundwork for statistical discrimination.","Bufan Gao, Xuechunzi Bai",Vingen 7,ABMs II,3,,893
2025-07-22 14:30:00,2025-07-22 16:00:00,session_presentation,Reasoning within and between collective action problems,"Summary: Understanding cooperation in social systems is challenging because the ever-changing rules that govern societies interact with individual actions, resulting in intricate collective outcomes. In virtual-world experiments, we allowed people to make changes in the systems that they are making decisions within and investigated how they weigh the influence of different rules in decision-making. When choosing between worlds differing in more than one rule, a naïve heuristics model predicted participants’ decisions as well, and in some cases better, than game earnings (utility) or by the subjective quality of single rules. In contrast, when a subset of engaged participants made instantaneous (“within-world”) decisions, their behavior aligned very closely with objective utility and not with the heuristics model. Findings suggest that, whereas choices between rules may deviate from rational benchmarks, the frequency of real time cooperation decisions to provide feedback can be a reliable indicator of the objective utility of these rules. Methods: We recruited 771 participants that provided consent in accordance with approved protocol. All participants were recruited online using Prolific and Amazon Mechanical Turk. We implemented asynchronous game design using PsyNet (https://www.psynet.dev/) for automated online Implementation. The 3D virtual environment was coded in Unity 3D and integrated with Psynet, which controlled the game logic and data collection. Game design: In each turn, participants navigate in virtual islands to search and collect coins. Each island had 20 collectable coins, each worth one cent. Participants commuted between islands by riding simulated ferries. Each ferry type corresponds to an arm in the embedded multi-arm-bandit (MAB) problem with a total of nine ferry types (=bandit arms) ranging in speed (Tchernichovski et al., 2023). In each turn, players choose between two arms (ferry types) selected from the overall nine. The bandit arm reward is the speed of the ferry, ranging between 2 and 30 seconds, with faster ferries providing participants more time at the destination to compete in coin collection. To add a “collective intelligence” dimension to the MAB, we implemented a public ferry rating dashboard, akin to public product rating on marketplaces. Results: We randomly assigned each participant to a game, with a combination of four binary engagement rules. For between game rule choices, we found that both objective utility and heuristic averaging models fit the rule choices fairly well, with predictions that are within the error margins for most rules and rule combinations. Interestingly, for the within game choices, the objective utility model gave even more accurate prediction of choice frequencies, with model estimates falling within the error margin of 10 out of the 12 treatment groups. In sharp contrast, the heuristic averaging model predictions, which are by design a perfect fit to the single rules, falls outside the error margins of all the combinations of rules, well below expectation (binomial test p= 0.008). Discussion: We evaluated how successful people are at forecasting their own collective’s behavior under increasingly complex conditions. We found that earning rate predicted choices between games to some extent, but so did the averaging heuristic. Interestingly, for the subset of participants who joined the club, heuristic averaging failed, but earning rate (objective utility) gave accurate predictions for the frequencies of instantaneous cooperation decisions within game. Whereas heuristic averaging failed, the objective utility model gave a good fit to the choice frequencies for both single rules and for combinations of rules. Are between-games decisions recruiting different faculties than decisions within them? What is it that made the within-game decisions more consistent with rationality? The subset of engaged participants who joined the club might have played more rationally compared to the general population, either because they were engaged, or because they self-selected the rules (Krebs et al., 2024). Alternatively, the decisions between games are less rational because they are removed from the game dynamics, whereas within game decisions are more rational because they are implicit (Ludwig et al., 2020). Either way, this outcome has interesting implications: modern communication technology enables real-time influence of citizens influence over the functioning of the system via online feedback. Overall, we hope that our study can contribute to the understanding of a transitivity formalism for forced binary decisions between social systems, comparing decisions made within- and between- artificial social worlds. Integrating recent advances in experiment design and institutional theory, should enable new inquiry into multi-level decision-making in complex social environments, towards a cognitive science of self-organized self-governance.","Ofer Tchernichovski, Seth Frey, Dalton C.

Building on the Mirroring Hypothesis, which posits that an organization’s formal structure reflects the technical dependencies of its work, our research investigates how decentralized labor becomes specialized over time. We reconstruct the development of Linux through empirical analysis of three data matrices: technical dependencies among source files, the mapping of developer contributions, and communication networks derived from email exchanges. An agent-based modeling approach, implemented using the Julia Agents library, simulates the evolution of synthetic Linux projects under various behavioral rules. These include response threshold dynamics, social influence mechanisms, and learning by patch acceptance. Calibration of the model against empirical data yielded an F-score of 0.721, demonstrating that labor division gradually aligns with technical architecture despite minimal formal managerial control. The findings challenge conventional notions that high degrees of mirroring are necessary for effective organizational efficiency, revealing instead that emergent social interactions and adaptive behaviors play a critical role. This work has significant theoretical implications for organizational theory and offers practical insights for managing open-source projects by enhancing collaboration and knowledge sharing in decentralized environments.

When is the perfect the enemy of the good? This type of question arises in many different contexts, including business, politics, resource exploitation, and our personal lives. Folk intuition suggests that people should aim for above-average results, but overreaching can lead to failure. Here, we mathematically formalize this intuition and relate it to empirical research across diverse domains. We model a search for strategies that have uncertain rewards over a fixed time period. The agent (i.e. searcher) knows the statistical distribution of rewards across strategies. At each time step, the agent either is satisfied and sticks with their current strategy or continues searching. We prove that the agent's optimal satisfaction threshold is both finite and strictly larger than the mean of available rewards. Compared to the optimal threshold, being too ambitious has a higher expected cost than being too cautious, implying that uncertainty over the reward distribution should motivate caution. The optimal satisfaction threshold becomes larger if the search time is longer, or if the reward distribution is rugged (i.e., has low autocorrelation) or left skewed. Using upward social comparison to assess the reward landscape biases agents towards never being satisfied, which decreases their expected performance substantially. We discuss how these insights can be applied empirically, using examples from entrepreneurship, economic policy, political campaigns, online dating, and college admissions.","Ekaterina Landgren, Ryan E.

The partner selection component makes these games akin to random matching, where defection is known to take over the entire population. Results in the literature have shown that, when forcing agents to obey a set partner selection rule known as Out-for-Tat, where defectors are systematically being broken ties with, cooperation can be sustained in the long run. In this paper, we remove this assumption and study agents that learn both action- and partner-selection strategies. Through multi-agent reinforcement learning, we show that cooperation can be sustained without forcing agents to play predetermined strategies.

This paper demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) could substantially reduce these cognitive burdens by translating natural language descriptions of market participant tastes into preferences. We invite 781 Prolific workers to describe their preferred types of tasks in natural language and rank a representative set of 50 tasks. An LLM is then provided with these natural language descriptions and put through utility elicitation exercises, which generate cardinal preferences over the 50 tasks for each participant. The rankings implied by these LLM-derived utilities track participants' own rank-orderings of the tasks. With these data, we simulate three matching mechanisms: (I) Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance using participants' own ranked lists; (ii) the Hylland-Zeckhauser pseudo-market, here supplied by the LLM-derived utilities; and (iii) a single-application lottery based on participants' top-ranked tasks. Simulations reveal that incorporating cardinal preference data from the LLM-derived utilities improves allocations, particularly in highly congested environments where many participants have the same preferences. A follow-up experiment confirms that participants themselves prefer LLM-generated matches over simpler alternatives under high congestion. Taken together, these findings suggest that LLM-driven preference elicitation can facilitate theoretically superior market designs in practice, particularly in settings such as labor markets where the stakes are high and detailed preference reporting over all options would otherwise be implausible.","Gili Rusak, Benjamin S.

2025-07-23 11:00:00,2025-07-23 12:30:00,session_presentation,Emotion Dynamics and the Consumption Paradox: Emotional Variance Predicts High Ratings but Low Popularity,"What makes some cultural products sell well even though they get bad reviews? And what leads others to sell poorly despite great reviews? While ratings and sales are often treated as interchangeable metrics of success, they can also conflict, particularly in cultural product markets like movies (Holbrook and Addis 2007). We propose that how much emotions fluctuate across the content—i.e., its emotional variance—matters. We hypothesize that while greater emotional variance can lead to better ratings, it can also hurt popularity. Greater emotional variance should create more engaging content, which should lead to higher ratings when people choose to consume it (e.g., Knight, Rocklage, and Bart 2024). Yet, this same variance may also deter people from choosing to consume it in the first place. When deciding what to watch or listen to, for example, it may seem like content with emotions that fluctuate widely would take more emotional effort to consume, thereby hurting its popularity. To test this pattern, we quantify emotion dynamics within tens of thousands of movie scripts, podcast transcripts, and song lyrics using computational linguistics and machine learning. Study 1 investigates movies. We obtained movie dialogue and action for a comprehensive set of 3,127 movies from OpenSubtitles.com. To measure emotional variance, we use a RoBERTa-based classifier (Lowe 2024) to quantify the six basic emotions—sadness, anger, fear, joy, surprise, and disgust (Ekman 1992)—from the text on-screen at each moment. This classifier has been validated in prior work (Demszky et al. 2020). We then compute emotion levels in 100 fixed-width windows to construct a continuous time series of each emotion over across each movie. An example of this approach is presented in Figure 1, where we show the emotional trajectories for The Lion King (1994). Emotions fluctuate considerably over the course of the movie, with a particular spike in sadness and anger halfway through the movie during and after Mufasa’s famous death. The movie then ends on a spike in anger, coinciding with the classic battle between Simba and Scar, before a final uptick in joy for a happy ending. To quantify a movie’s emotional variance, we compute the variance of each emotion across movie percentiles and then average those variances together for a single index. Each movie’s rating was measured using its average star rating from IMDb.com and popularity was measured by its box office revenue (i.e., how many people went to see it). As predicted, regression models find that while greater emotional variance predicts higher ratings (b = 469.13, t(3118) = 3.24, p = .001), it predicts lower popularity (b = -1846.79, t(3118) = -6.32, p < .001). These results hold (ps < .05) even when examining a number of alternative explanations by including controls for genre fixed effects, audience demographics (age, gender), budget, year-of-release fixed effects, maturity rating fixed effects, script wordcount, and the average level of each emotion across the movie. Thus, greater emotional variance predicts better ratings, but comes at a cost for popularity. Study 2 examines the generalizability of the effect across podcasts. We obtained transcripts for 1,676 episodes (Spotify 2020) and matched them with each episode’s average rating and listener counts (popularity) from Rephonic, an online metadata aggregator for podcasts. We find an identical pattern as with movies: greater emotional variance predicts higher ratings (b = 54.31, t(1667) = 5.19, p < .001) but lower popularity (b = -90.45, t(1667) = -3.12, p = .002). These results again persist controlling for an large set of alternative explanations (ps < .05), including genre fixed effects, year fixed effects, wordcount, and the average level of each emotion. Finally, Study 3 further investigates generalizability by examining 15,010 songs. We obtained song lyrics from the Music4All database (Santana et al., 2020). These were matched with ratings from Pitchfork, a well-known music evaluation website, and Spotify’s popularity index, a measure based on how frequently a song is played by different users. Again, we find that greater emotional variance significantly predicts higher ratings (b = 9.98, t(15001) = 3.42, p = .001) but lower popularity (b = -182.40, t(15001) = -7.73, p < .001). These results hold even when controlling for a large set of alternative explanations (ps < .05) including genre fixed effects, year fixed effects, wordcount, and the average level of each emotion, as well as beyond musical characteristics coded by Spotify such as tempo, mode, valence, key, and danceability. Taken together, these findings suggest a fundamental tension in the success of cultural products: content with greater emotional variance earns higher ratings but is less popular across movies, podcasts, and songs.","Samsun Knight, Matthew D.

Algorithmic Landlords, Market Competition, and the Influence Network of Price Diffusion","The growing adoption of algorithmic rent-setting tools by corporate landlords has reshaped the rental housing market, raising concerns about price inflation, market competition, and housing affordability. This study examines the role of algorithm-driven landlords in shaping rent price dynamics, investigating whether they act as price setters who initiate market-wide changes or merely follow broader trends. Using a comprehensive dataset of weekly rent observations, ownership records, and neighborhood characteristics in Milwaukee County from 2018 to 2023, we employ descriptive and network-based methodologies to analyze pricing behaviors and rent diffusion patterns. Our findings reveal that algorithmic landlords exhibit distinct pricing strategies, characterized by frequent, synchronized rent adjustments that contribute to market segmentation and price convergence. Leveraging Graph Attention Networks (GAT), we construct an influence network that captures the diffusion of rent changes, identifying key price-setting landlords and tracing the hierarchical spread of rent inflation across socioeconomic and racialized market segments. Our results suggest that algorithmic landlords play a central role in shaping rental market trends, accelerating rent homogenization and disproportionately impacting lower-income communities. This study provides critical insights into the implications of algorithm-driven pricing on market competition, housing inequality, and regulatory policy.","Eunsung Yoon, Sasrah Johnson, Carl Gershenson",Vingen 7,Economics I,5,,948

Here we introduce a machine learning method to estimate the GDP per capita of dozens of countries and hundreds of regions in Europe and North America for the past 700 years starting from data on the places of birth, death, and occupations of hundreds of thousands of historical figures. We build an elastic net regression model to perform feature selection and generate out-of-sample estimates that explain 90% of the variance in known historical income levels. We use this model to generate GDP per capita estimates for countries, regions, and time periods for which this data is not available and externally validate our estimates by comparing them with four proxies of economic output: urbanization rates in the past 500 years, body height in the 18th century, wellbeing in 1850, and church building activity in the 14th and 15th century. Additionally, we show our estimates reproduce the well-known reversal of fortune between southwestern and northwestern Europe between 1300 and 1800 and find this is largely driven by countries and regions engaged in Atlantic trade. These findings validate the use of fine-grained biographical data as a method to produce historical GDP per capita estimates. We publish our estimates with confidence intervals together with all collected source data in a comprehensive dataset.","Philipp Koch, Viktor Stojkoski, Cesar A Hidalgo",Vingen 7,Economics I,6,,14

2025-07-23 14:30:00,2025-07-23 16:00:00,session_presentation,Breaking the HISCO Barrier: Automatic Occupational Standardization with OccCANINE,"The classification of historical occupational data has long been a labor-intensive and error-prone task. The Historical International Standard Classification of Occupations (HISCO) provides a widely used framework for categorizing such data (Leeuwen, Maas, & Miles, 2002), but manual assignment remains cumbersome and time-consuming. This paper introduces OccCANINE, a novel machine learning tool designed to automate the transformation of occupational descriptions into HISCO codes with high accuracy, significantly reducing the workload for researchers in economic history and related disciplines. The ability to standardize historical occupational data is essential for studying social mobility, labor markets, and economic development. However, manually coding occupational descriptions into HISCO categories is a slow and resource-intensive process. Even an expert researcher can only classify a limited number of descriptions per hour, meaning that large-scale datasets require weeks or months of effort. Traditional methods, such as rule-based string matching, struggle with the inherent complexity of historical data, including linguistic variations, spelling inconsistencies, and contextual ambiguities. The demand for a more efficient, scalable, and replicable solution has driven the development of OccCANINE. OccCANINE is a fine-tuned transformer-based language model built on CANINE, a pre-trained model designed for multilingual text processing (Clark, Garrette, Turc, & Wieting, 2022). It has been trained on a dataset of 14 million occupational descriptions and their corresponding HISCO codes across 13 languages, leveraging contributions from 22 different and diverse sources. By incorporating both character-level tokenization and deep learning-based contextual understanding, OccCANINE achieves remarkable robustness against spelling errors and linguistic variations. The model takes an occupational description as input -- optionally accompanied by language context -- and outputs the most relevant HISCO codes. We evaluated the model's performance on 1 million validation observations. It achieved 93.5% accuracy, precision of 95.5%, recall of 98.7%, and an F1-score of 96.0%. We performed additional validation on out-of-distribution datasets, including the Copenhagen Burial Records (Denmark) (Robinson, Mathiesen, Thomsen, & Revuelta-Eugercios, 2022), Indefatigable Training Ship Data (UK) (Schneider & Gao, 2019), Swedish strike records (Enflo, Molinder, & Karlsson, 2022), and Dutch tax records from 1674 (Soetermeer, 1674). In these tests, OccCANINE maintained accuracy above 90% and substantial agreement with human-coded labels. A key challenge in occupational classification is the presence of rare occupations. OccCANINE's accuracy remains high across common occupations, but performance slightly declines for rare occupations due to limited training data. This issue can be mitigated through task-specific fine-tuning, which OccCANINE supports. By automating HISCO classification, OccCANINE lowers the barrier to historical occupational research, enabling larger-scale studies and freeing researchers from the tedious task of manual coding. In ongoing work, we are training OccCANINE to support additional occupational classification schemes, including OCC1950, ISCO, PTSI, and OCCICEM, training on more than 100 million occupational descriptions. Further, the methods we use in this paper are also applicable to other classification tasks in historical data processing, such as analyzing trade records, educational qualifications, or demographic registers, which we plan to explore more in the future. OccCANINE effectively ``breaks the HISCO barrier,'' transforming what was once an arduous manual task into a rapid, automated process. By leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques, the tool enhances the accuracy, efficiency, and replicability of historical occupational classification. This development opens new possibilities for economic historians, sociologists, and researchers across the social sciences, facilitating more comprehensive studies of occupational change and social mobility over time. OccCANINE is publicly available, with open-source code and training guides accessible via GitHub. We encourage researchers to validate its performance on their datasets and, if necessary, fine-tune it for specialized applications.","Torben S. D.

Government organizations have historically played a crucial role in fostering national innovation systems. This study investigates the evolutionary process of AI technology, focusing on the unique contributions of three innovation types: intramural, extramural, and private. We utilize the Artificial Intelligence Patent Dataset 2023 (AIPD 2023), which comprises all granted AI patents from 1976 to 2023, augmented with metadata to classify innovation types. Our final dataset includes 5,265 intramural, 35,871 extramural, and 808,652 private. We further examine the content of these patents by constructing a landscape of AI innovation using BERT embeddings and applying UMAP to reduce dimensionality. Subsequently, we assign labels to high-density regions via different label code systems. The results indicate that intramural and extramural innovation types focus on fundamental AI technologies compared to the private innovation type. In contrast, the private innovation type has steadily shifted toward commercialization. Moreover, the extramural innovation type bridges public and private interests, maintaining traditional research areas while adapting to emerging fields. Our findings reveal the complementary interplay among intramural, extramural, and private research efforts. By analyzing the contributions and the complementary nature of each entity involved in patenting activity, this study provides an empirical foundation for optimizing the allocation of public funds to maximize overall impact.","DoeunKim, Sungkyu Shaun Park, Jaehyuk Park",Vingen 7,Economics II,3,,668
2025-07-23 14:30:00,2025-07-23 16:00:00,session_presentation,Digitalization and changes in ICT-related skill demands,"Technological change and digitalization (hereafter TC&D) are driving some of the most significant transformations in modern societies, rapidly reshaping how we learn, work, and interact (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014; Helbing 2015). While occupations related to information and communications technology (ICT) have profoundly grown in demand, ICT skills are increasingly required across nearly all job types (Oesch 2013). A major anticipated development in this context was the reduction of gender inequalities in the labor market, driven by factors such as a decreased emphasis on physical strength and increased job flexibility (Black and Spitz-Oener 2010, Weinberg 2000). However, gender inequalities did not disappear, and progress toward gender equity in the labor market has stalled (England, Levine, and Mishel 2020, Minkus and Busch-Heizmann 2020). Today, it seems that TC&D might even lead to increasing gender inequality as well-paid complex programming tasks are male dominated (Cheng, Chauhan, and Chintala 2019). To understand if, how, and under what conditions TC&D influence men’s and women’s employment and wages, nuanced measures of digitalization in the labor market are indispensable. However, to date, no longitudinal data exist that allow for a time-sensitive analysis of within-occupation changes in ICT-related skill demands. Addressing this data gap, our project aims to create an innovative retrospective measure of TC&D at the occupational level by analyzing historical job vacancy advertisements to model skill-demand changes over time. Building on prior research using newspaper vacancy ads to measure ICT tasks in the labor market (see Swiss Labour Market Monitor; Buchmann, Buchs, and Gnehm 2020), our project expands this approach in both scale and scope. Using computational methods on archival data, we develop a longitudinal measure of changes in occupational skill demands. We outline the process steps, including the application of various CSS techniques, and present preliminary analyses derived from our measure. The creation of this novel measure includes three major steps (see Figure 1): a) systematic collection and extraction of digitalized newspaper job advertisements, b) mapping of job ads to occupation classification codes (KldB 2010), and c) identification and classification of ICT-related skill requirements in the advertised jobs. In the first step (a), we contacted all newspaper publishers in Germany to request access to their digitized archives for the period 1975 to 2024. These archives are primarily accessible via regular newspaper subscriptions. To refine our dataset to include only pages containing job advertisements, we combine keyword searches and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, such as word embeddings, which capture the semantic context of job ads. Finally, to automatically isolate and extract individual job vacancy ads as discrete units, we apply an object detection tool (e.g., YOLO) trained on manually annotated samples (Figure 1, step 1). In the second step (b), we map job vacancy ads to job codes in Germany’s most widely used occupational classification system (KldB 2010). To accomplish this, we leverage pre-trained models for job classification (e.g., JobBERT). As the wordings of job titles in some areas have changed considerably across our observation period, often to avoid gender-typing (e.g., Stewardess / Flight Attendant), harmonization of the titles across time is necessary. Mapping to this job classification system is a crucial step as it enables the linkage of our new measure of ICT-related skill requirements within specific occupations to other datasets, such as social security records (Figure 1, step 2). In the third step (c), we use machine learning algorithms to extract and structure all relevant information from the job ads, with a particular focus on ICT-related skill requirements. To classify skill demands as ICT-related, we draw on official skill requirement lists of the German Federal Employment Agency. This approach allows us to develop a robust measure of occupational skill changes over time, independent of evolving job titles (Figure 1, step 3). For the first time, our newly developed measure will enable researchers to link data on intra-occupational ICT task changes with longitudinal administrative data, such as the Integrated Employment Biographies from the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) in Germany. This opens new avenues for studying employment and wage dynamics in German workplaces across different demographic groups—including men and women—while accounting for the complex and varying digitalization processes across occupations.","Isabel Gebhardt, Timon Drewes, Malte Reichelt",Vingen 7,Economics II,4,,346

This study addresses this gap by investigating the spatial distribution of labor market transformations with two main aims: analyzing regional patterns of skill demand and examining how skill demand has evolved over time. Adopting a skill-based and data-driven perspective, we analyze online job advertisements (OJAs) from 29 countries between 2019 and 2023 at the NUTS3 level, the smallest territorial unit in the European regional classification. Based on skill demand structures, we identify 11 regional clusters, highlighting varying degrees of labor market segmentation and territorial inequalities. Between 2019 and 2023, job requirements have become increasingly complex, with a growing complementarity between digital and traditional skills. Finally, we find that the pace of skill transformation varies regionally, following distinct spatial patterns. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt to cluster European regions using a data-driven, skill-based approach with online job advertisement data.","Ioana Gabriela Doleanu, Diego Giuliani, Ivano Bison",Vingen 7,Economics II,5,,283

Similar trends in Global North countries contribute to a global public health challenge. In 2016, China shifted from a one-child policy to a two-child policy to boost fertility. While research has explored the effects on fertility behaviors, little attention has been paid to how this policy change impacts citizens' perceptions of family planning and fertility barriers. This study analyzes Chinese citizens’ fertility-related appeals from 2011 to 2022 on the e-petition platform (Message Board for Leaders) and examines government responses through posts on Weibo, China’s leading social media platform. We use computational social science methods, such as Dynamic Bertopic Modeling and sentiment analysis with RoBerta, to identify trends and policy impacts. The analysis employs a Difference-in-Differences approach to examine the effects of changing fertility policies. **Data and Methods** The Message Board for Leaders, a government-run platform, allows citizens to express demands to officials. We collected fertility-related texts from 2011 to 2022 through keyword search and fuzzy matching. This period spans multiple phases of family planning policies, including the one-child policy (up to 2013), selective two-child policy (2014), universal two-child policy (2015), and three-child policy (2021). After cleaning, 9,862 texts were obtained, and the Dynamic BERTopic model identified public demands by clustering sentence embeddings. We also collected posts from five high-following Weibo accounts (People’s Daily, Xinhua News, China Daily, China News Weekly, and China News Service) related to fertility policy using the keyword “fertility.” A total of 321 posts were manually categorized into news, policies, proposals, and polls. To assess public feedback, we supplemented this with data from TikTok, focusing on comments under fertility-related posts. A random sample was labeled for classification using RoBerta, achieving over 87% accuracy. **Preliminary Findings** Analysis of citizen appeals on Message Board for Leaders revealed six key themes in fertility-related demands: i) household registration, ii) maternity leave, iii) childbirth subsidy, iv) school enrollment, v) healthcare coverage, and vi) remarried families. Longitudinal shifts show a decline in concerns about household registration (linked to the one-child policy) after 2016, while child-rearing cost concerns have surged. This correlates with the shift in China’s family planning policy, indicating that relaxed fertility regulations have refocused public attention on support measures such as financial assistance and postnatal recovery. Government responses on Weibo show that policies addressing concerns like non-marital births, school enrollment, and workplace gender discrimination have been implemented. However, public feedback reveals that these efforts have not fully met expectations. The four most discussed policies are shown in Fig 4. Public feedback can be categorized into three main concerns: 1. Insufficient support for childbirth, with complaints about low fertility subsidies and short maternity leave. 2. Limited scope of fertility support, with citizens calling for more comprehensive policies covering preconception, school enrollment, and healthcare. 3. Narrow target populations, with many calling for fertility benefits to extend to families with only one child. **Future Work** Future work will investigate the interplay between public demands and government responses, incorporating official policy documents and announcements on Weibo. This will enhance understanding of how government policy has evolved. A Difference-in-Differences approach will also be applied to analyze the impact of the two-child policy on citizens' fertility intentions and demands, offering insights into the causal effects of the policy shift.","Jie Hua, Pu Yan, Jiamin Li",Vingen 8,Governance & Policy,2,,399
2025-07-24 11:00:00,2025-07-24 12:30:00,session_presentation,Tracking corruption around the globe -- automated methods for identifying different forms of corruption in news coverage,"The study of political corruption in media coverage is essential for understanding public discourse, institutional accountability, and governance. Corruption, along with its various manifestations, has been widely debated in academic and policy discussions. However, to systematically study corruption coverage in news across countries and over time, we need to scale up the analysis through automated methods. Detecting and categorizing corruption-related content in large-scale textual data remains a challenge due to definitional complexities, terminological variations, and contextual nuances. In this study, we present a comparative analysis of machine learning and large language models (LLMs) to assess the accuracy and efficiency of different approaches for identifying and categorizing corruption-related news content across nine countries from 2018 to 2023. Our current analysis covers Sweden, the Netherlands, the UK, Hungary, Italy, France, Ukraine, and Serbia, representing countries with varying levels of corruption and trust in government. If successful, we aim to extend this approach to additional countries. Our dataset consists of news articles collected from various media outlets via the Event Registry API. We employ extensive keyword-based dictionaries designed to capture a broad spectrum of corruption-related terms, prioritizing high recall. These dictionaries were developed and translated by an international team of experts, including native speakers of each of the nine languages. However, to (1) increase precision and filter for articles that are actually about political corruption and (2) distinguish between different forms of corruption, additional steps are required beyond keyword searches. Our primary objective is twofold: first, to develop a robust classification pipeline that can accurately determine whether an article is truly about political corruption, and second, to classify articles into specific types of political corruption. This classification is informed by prior cross-national corruption studies (Hajdu, Pápay, Szántó, & Tóth, 2018) and considers three key dimensions: (1) whether corruption is framed as an individual or systemic problem, (2) the identification and representation of victims, and (3) the event arena, distinguishing between national and subnational levels. To achieve these goals, we employ a range of computational approaches. We begin with classical supervised learning techniques such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), and random forests, using manually labeled subsets as training corpora. These methods provide interpretable baselines and allow us to assess the performance of traditional text classification models. Next, we experiment with transformer-based models such as BERT and RoBERTa, which have demonstrated superior performance in text classification tasks. Finally, we explore the potential of open-source LLMs such as LLaMA, Mistral, and Falcon to evaluate their effectiveness in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned corruption classification tasks, with particular attention to prompt stability (Barrie, Palaiologou, & Törnberg, 2024). Future extensions could also incorporate multilingual embeddings and contrastive learning techniques to better handle linguistic diversity. Our study provides insights into the trade-offs between different modeling approaches in terms of accuracy, generalizability, and computational efficiency. Additionally, we examine cross-national differences in media coverage, considering linguistic and contextual variations in corruption framing. Our findings contribute to the broader computational social science literature by demonstrating how different machine learning paradigms can be leveraged to analyze political discourse at scale. Furthermore, the study has practical implications for researchers and policymakers seeking to monitor corruption narratives and their impact on public perception and governance. By systematically testing multiple modeling strategies, this research advances the methodological toolkit for studying corruption-related discourse in news media. It offers a comparative evaluation of traditional and cutting-edge machine learning models in text classification and lays the foundation for a scalable and adaptable framework for future studies on political corruption in the media landscape. Potential future directions include refining our approach for real-time monitoring of corruption-related discourse and integrating multimodal data sources, such as social media and parliamentary debates, to enrich our understanding of corruption narratives across different platforms.","Felicia Loecherbach, Anne C Kroon, Chris D.R.O.

Governance decisions in DAOs also exhibit extraordinarily high approval rates (over 90%), a quote that even surpasses many other online voting systems known for having approval bias. This paper investigates the high approval rates in DAOs trying to disentangle three main components: approval bias, author bias, and position bias. For our analysis, we collected 5.7 millions governance votes from the Snapshot platform (https://snapshot.org]), the largest off-chain governance platform available. We then preprocessed them and via mix of heuristics, custom filtering, and manual inspection we assigned to every choice of every proposal a stance, i.e., whether a given choice is ""approving"", ""rejecting"" the proposal, or if it is an ""abstain"" choice or ""other"". Via visual inspection and econometric analysis we are able to quantify the relative strength of the biases and find that, while all contribute the high approval rates of governance proposals, the author bias is the strongest one. Our results call for more transparency in the voting processes and in the identities and goals of the authors of governance proposals.","Stefano Balietti, Stefan Kitzler, Pietro Saggese, Markus Strohmaier, Bernhard Haslhofer",Vingen 8,Governance & Policy,5,,903

While collaborative governance has been extensively studied through case studies, a systematic framework for understanding its evolution and impact on social order remains underdeveloped. Leveraging computational methods and qualitative analysis, this study aims to bridge that gap. The research utilizes a 100-year corpus of Swedish Government Official Reports (SOUs), comprising 8,891 documents, to trace the development of ""samverkan"" as a central administrative strategy. A five-step methodological framework was designed to analyze shifts in the term’s meaning and usage. The findings indicate that ""samverkan"" has evolved from a general notion of cooperation to a more structured and institutionalized governance tool. The word’s occurrence increased significantly from the 1970s onward, reflecting a broader societal shift toward interagency and intersectoral coordination. Word2Vec word embeddings and Word Rain visualizations indicate that ""samverkan"" is increasingly associated with strategic governance processes and diffused into more societal domains. Furthermore, a sentence transformer-based topic modeling approach identifies 74 recurring thematic areas where ""samverkan"" is prominently discussed, further illustrating its growing significance in the executive administrative discourse. Qualitative close-readings provide deeper insights into key conceptual transformations. In conclusion, ""samverkan"" has emerged as a ""soft"" governance mechanism, shaping Sweden’s public administration by encouraging cross-sectoral collaboration while maintaining state control. The findings demonstrate the value of the proposed methodological framework in capturing discourse-driven institutional change and suggest its applicability to other domains focusing on social order.","Josef Ginnerskov, Matilda Hellman, Maria Skeppstedt",Vingen 8,Governance & Policy,6,,416

We examine how corresponding author gender influences media citations to scientific research across fields. We reveal that women-led papers are more likely to appear in media where women are underrepresented but receive fewer citations overall. Women authors are overrepresented in local media and underrepresented in national and specialty outlets. Sentiment analysis shows men-led papers are more frequently associated with positive sentiment, while women-led papers face more negative sentiment.

Traditionally, their reliability is attributed to the high accuracy rates achieved in standardised benchmarks. However, these benchmarks almost always depend on datasets in which sentiment or emotions have been labeled by third-party annotators, rather than the individuals experiencing these emotions themselves. In this paper, we use a unique, large-scale dataset of self-annotated posts to show that automatic classifiers have consistently higher error rates for texts authored by men both for positive and negative emotions. We then use computational modelling to estimate how this bias might affect the results obtained from applying automatic classification to gender-heterogeneous samples in downstream application. Our results demonstrate that machine learning tools should be applied with caution in contexts where gender could be a confounding variable. They also highlight that more research is needed to improve the accuracy of emotion detection, particularly in gender-diverse settings.","Ivan Smirnov, David Garcia, Segun Aroyehun, Paul Plener",Hemeryck,Gender Bias,2,,663

This study examines gender representation in French news (1995–2024) by measuring the distributional differences of masculine and feminine professional titles using Wasserstein-Cosine similarity, which quantifies shifts in contextual usage over time. Results reveal that high-status professions exhibit greater gender similarity than artistic or employee-level roles, with terms like avocat/avocate and président/présidente showing higher contextual alignment. Over time, similarity scores have generally increased across all professional categories, suggesting a gradual linguistic convergence of gendered terms, though this trend is more pronounced in high-status professions.","Salah Zrigui, François Portet, Gilles Bastin",Hemeryck,Gender Bias,3,,809

No gap exists for conventional innovations. Rather, the gap is pervasively rooted in innovations that combine ideas in unexpected ways – innovations most critical to scientific breakthroughs. Further, at the USPTO we find that female examiners reject up to 33 percent more unconventional innovations by women inventors than do male examiners, suggesting that gender discrimination weakly explains this innovation gap. Instead, new data indicate that a configuration of institutional practices explains the innovation gap. These practices compromise the expertise women examiners need to accurately assess unconventional innovations and then “over-assign” women examiners to women innovators, undermining women’s innovations. These institutional impediments negatively impact innovation rates in science but have the virtue of being more amenable to actionable policy changes than does culturally ingrained gender discrimination.","Tara Sowrirajan, Ryan Whalen, Brian Uzzi",Hemeryck,Gender Bias,4,,464

While previous work has demonstrated the existence of gender-bias in judgments, these studies are mainly based on controlled experiments that may not reflect real-world decision-making processes. Here, we study how moral judgments are biased by the gender of the protagonist of a story. Using data from /r/AITA, a Reddit community with 17 million members who share first-hand experiences seeking community judgment on their behavior, we employ machine learning techniques to match stories describing similar situations that differ only by the protagonist's gender. We find no direct causal effect of the protagonist's gender on the received moral judgments, except for stories about ``friendship and relationships'', where male protagonists receive more negative judgments. Our findings complement existing correlational studies and suggest that gender roles may exert greater influence in specific social contexts.

2025-07-23 14:30:00,2025-07-23 16:00:00,session_presentation,Female managers are judged more harshly even when they are AI,"The increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in workplaces is transforming its function from merely enhancing efficiency to actively shaping organizational decision-making, sparking discussions on the evolving dynamics between humans and machines [1]. People often perceive AI entities as having human-like qualities, including gender, due to anthropomorphism — the attribution of human traits, emotions, or intentions to non-human entities. However, how AI managers are perceived compared with human managers, and how their perceived gender influences these views, remains unclear. Issues such as fairness, biases, organizational justice, trust, morale, and willingness to collaborate within teams are becoming increasingly important as AI reshapes the future of leadership and management. To explore these dynamics, we conducted a series of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) where teams of three participants worked collaboratively while a randomly assigned manager, varying in type (human or AI) and gender (female, male, or unspecified), selected the best player for an additional award (Fig. 1). While in reality the awardee was selected at random, this setting allowed us to measure how participants’ evaluation of the decision made by the manager depends on the manager’s characteristics under the same conditions. Findings: While participants showed little preference based on manager type or gender prior to treatment, award outcomes significantly shaped their perceptions of the manager's fairness, with the magnitude of the influence moderated by manager type, manager gender, and the participants' own gender. As shown in Fig. 2, Male managers received greater appreciation than female managers from awarded participants. When awards were not received, controlling for participants' gender effect, disillusionment was stronger for female managers, especially female-AI. As shown in Fig. 3, relative to the reference category (awarded by a human-male manager), not receiving an award significantly lowers perceived fairness for female-AI managers, female-human managers, and AI managers of unspecified gender. Additionally, fairness perceptions are strongly influenced by an expectation-reward dynamic. Not receiving an award, particularly when participants perceived their own contribution as high, led to a significant reduction in fairness ratings for both human and AI managers. Discussion: Our findings align with pervasive societal stereotypes that link competence and leadership effectiveness with male figures [3]. The reinforcement of positive recognition for male managers, and especially male-AI managers (Fig. 2), could reflect societal tendencies to perceive male-led successes as more expected or legitimate, a bias that some have argued is deeply ingrained in patriarchal organizational structures [4]. Furthermore, algorithmic neutrality and objectivity [5] may intersect here, as male-AI managers might benefit from a dual layer of presumed objectivity: male leadership and AI precision. Conversely, negative outcomes notably harmed perceptions of female managers, particularly female-AI managers, where skepticism toward AI decision-making compounded existing gender biases to yield harsher judgments. Female human managers also faced notable declines, though to a lesser extent, possibly due to the perception that human managers demonstrate greater accountability and empathy. By contrast, male managers exhibited greater resilience to negative outcomes, likely due to societal leniency afforded to male figures, consistent with status expectations theory [3]. This underscores the moderating role of gender in shaping perceptions of managerial decisions, revealing a deeply embedded double standard where cultural narratives shield male leaders with presumed competence and external locus of control, while female leaders face greater blame for unfavorable outcomes. These findings resonate with broader feminist critiques that women’s roles and societal positions are often disproportionately scrutinized within a male-dominated societal framework [6]. The findings offer insights for the design and deployment of AI systems for leadership and management roles. The amplified negative impact on female-AI managers emphasizes the need to address intersectional biases in workplace dynamics, where gender and technology intersect to create compounded disadvantages. Organizations aiming to integrate AI in leadership roles should consider strategies to mitigate such biases, such as transparency in AI decision-making processes and fostering a culture that values fairness and equity. Furthermore, the results point to the importance of aligning performance outcomes with fairness perceptions, as these evaluations can significantly influence trust, collaboration, and organizational morale.","Hao Cui, Taha Yasseri",Hemeryck,Gender Bias,6,,315

Traditional explanations usually focus on job characteristics, reward structures, and gendered preferences. While these theories effectively explain segregation between occupations (e.g., doctors vs. nurses), they struggle to offer compelling explanations for observed within-occupation segregation (e.g., surgeons vs. neurologists) and temporal shifts in gender composition. One mechanism that has received increasing attention is the interdependent labor mobility of men and women, summarized in the idea of feminizing occupations. What these rationales neglect, however, is that individuals are not only embedded in occupations but also in workplaces and that workplaces, like occupations, can be gender segregated. Using the lens of Analytical Sociology, this study explores the idea that workplace segregation may have a shielding effect on sorting at the occupational level. Assuming that people prefer to work with some number of colleagues like them, we hypothesize that individuals tolerate an increasing presence of others in their occupation as long as their immediate workplace remains similar to themselves. Using detailed register data from Sweden, we measure the experienced inflows of same-sex and opposite-sex workers into an individual’s occupation and workplace over time, as well as the effects of changes in gender composition on an individual’s choice to change their occupation. Our results indicate significant variation in workplace compositions, meaning that we find individuals who work in gender-equal occupations but gender-segregated workplaces and vice versa. Simulation analysis supports the idea that workplace segregation moderates occupational-level dynamics. These findings challenge macro-level segregation models and highlight the importance of localized workplace dynamics. Our study contributes to the understanding of occupational gender segregation by linking workplace structures to broader labor market patterns, potentially offering new ideas for tackling the “leaky pipeline” effect of career progression.","Alexandra Rottenkolber, Martin Arvidsson, Károly Takács",Vingen 6,Inequality & Segregation I,1,,749

Specifically, we define and estimate a pay gap we refer to as the Gender-Class Pay Gap. To this end, we compare established decomposition methods (Oaxaca (1973); Gelbach (2016)) with counterfactual mediation analysis (e.g., Blakely et al. (2018)) to decompose this gap. We argue that mediation analysis offers a more credible approach to gap decompositions than conventional methods, as it accounts for the underlying temporal structure. Traditional decomposition methods treat controls as if they occur before or simultaneously with the treatment. In contrast, mediation analysis allows for a distinction between pre-treatment controls (referred to as controls) and post-treatment ”controls” (referred to as mediators), thereby providing a clearer understanding of causal pathways. This distinction enhances the credibility of the analysis and sheds light on the mechanisms driving our findings. Further, our approach allows for including controls in the potential outcome framework. Using data from the German Socioeconomic Panel (2010–2019), our results reveal that even after achieving upward social mobility, individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds earn significantly less labor income than peers of comparable current socioeconomic status but higher socioeconomic family background. While the gap is alleviated when accounting for, among other factors, occupational and educational sorting, it remains both statistically and economically significant. Crucially, when analyzing women and men separately, we find that the class pay gap is almost entirely driven by men. Among women, the socioeconomic family background is not associated with significant differences in pay. Remarkably, however, women from high-class backgrounds earn significantly less than men from low-class backgrounds, even when controlling for occupational sorting, education, part-time work, and other relevant factors. This highlights a striking reality: even the most privileged women earn less than the least privileged men. We believe our findings offer a novel perspective on the interplay between gender and socioeconomic disparities in labor income, adding a new dimension to the discussion of the gender pay gap.",Raffael Kind,Vingen 6,Inequality & Segregation I,2,,194

Compared to older men, older women are less likely to be employed, especially in full-time jobs, and more likely to be inactive or retired. While theory and prior empirical work suggest that these disparities are largely attributable to men’s and women’s unequal positions in the occupational hierarchy, the exact extent of this effect remains unclear. To fill this gap, this article employs a novel non-parametric and doubly-robust causal decomposition approach based on high-quality census data from Germany (n > 2,900,000). The estimation builds on a SuperLearner ensemble that flexibly combines multiple machine learning algorithms. First, I document considerable disparities in several labour market outcomes between older men and women aged 55 to 64 (total, full- and part-time employment; unemployment; inactivity; and retirement). Surprisingly and contrary to expectations, I then find that a gender-equal occupational structure would not substantially reduce these disparities, and would even slightly increase the gender disparity in part-time employment. These results hold in both East and West Germany, across three decades from 1991 to 2020, and if the occupational structure is equalised only within levels of educational attainment. These findings suggest that other factors, notably women’s lower labour market attachment in mid-life, likely account for most of the observed disparities. More generally, they question the role of occupational gender segregation as a mechanism behind gender disparities in late working lives and illustrate the benefits of novel causal decomposition and machine learning methods for empirical social science research.",Jan Einhoff,Vingen 6,Inequality & Segregation I,3,,336

With the digital revolution, people’s communication exceedingly shifted to the online space, allowing the collection of detailed linguistical digital footprints. This digital data, along with the rise of more sophisticated, context-sensitive embedding models like the BERT (Bidirectional Encoding Representations for Transformers) model [2], makes it possible to analyze linguistic patterns in more detail. The aim of the study is thus to examine what latent patterns can be identified in the relationship between online textual expressions and social status by analyzing the classification results of neural network-based models, specifically focusing on the aspects of language. The research aims to answer this question by fine-tuning a BERT and by using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) [3] values to try to find patterns in linguistic use among different social classes. In other words, the paper seeks to answer whether we can detect patterns in language usage across people of different social statuses, and if so, what these patterns are. While in many western countries Facebook usage seems to be on the decline [4], in Hungary it remained a significant social media platform, even among younger generations [5]. The data used by the study is collected via a novel data donation approach [6] among Hungarian Facebook users. First, respondents were asked to fill out a questionnaire, and then they were asked to download their own social media data. Data collection lasted from January 2023 to June 2023, and the final sample consisted of 758 individuals. The final sample is representative of the Hungarian internet user population in terms of gender, age, and geographical region. For the current study, ~2.5M Hungarian Facebook posts and comments were used. Each user was given a social class category based on a five-category version of the European socio-economic classification (ESeC) [7]. ESeC relies on John Goldthorpe’s [8] occupation-based classification scheme. Next, a BERT model was fine-tuned on the posts and comments of these users with the objective to predict the ESeC categories. The results shows that it is possible to train BERT models to classify Facebook comments and posts with an F1 score above 0.7, and by interpreting their SHAP values, relevant findings can be revealed in the differing patterns of language usage by various social classes. While the study is limited to a few linguistic patterns, among which are pronoun usage patterns, punctuation, and emoji usage, it shows promising results for further, more detailed analysis. Some results are underpinned by previous research on the English language and social class [9], while others are open for further research. Results suggest that the overall most influential (highest absolute SHAP value) tokens are prominently function words and punctuation marks. Our results suggest that respondents from lower classes are more characterized by the usage of the sentence terminator dot sign, and the usage of question marks has a negative effect. The study argues that the applied method provides an exploratory perspective that enables the detailed examination of linguistic elements, as the contextual embeddings of BERT allow language to be understood not as a static variable. The study quantitatively demonstrate the linguistic differences of five social classes, focusing primarily on the tokens deemed most important for classification, as well as differences in punctuation and emoji usage. The results are promising in terms of contributing to both the classification and interpretation of linguistic content appearing in social media, thereby aiding a deeper understanding of linguistic markers related to social structures. Our results show that, in contrast to traditional statistical methods, a broader, more exploratory approach could provide deeper insights into how symbolic power relations manifest in everyday language use. Analyzing Hungarian comments and posts from Facebook separately, as well as controlling for the parent’s social class to control for intergenerational mobility, might yield clearer results. Trying the same method but with English or multilingual texts can also provide insight into the language patterns different social classes use. While the results are by no means flawless or definitive, the study demonstrates that by examining SHAP values in deep learning-based classification models, it is possible to reveal potentially significant correlations between language use and social class. This, in turn, contributes to a more nuanced understanding of class relations and social stratification.","Bendegúz Váradi, Zoltan Kmetty",Vingen 6,Inequality & Segregation I,4,,794

Assessing the Effect of Reporting Delays on Disparity Assessments,"Prior work has documented widespread racial and ethnic inequities across sectors, such as healthcare, finance, and technology. Across all of these domains, conducting disparity assessments at regular time intervals is critical for surfacing potential biases in decision-making and improving outcomes across demographic groups. Because disparity assessments fundamentally depend on the availability of demographic information, their efficacy is limited by the availability and consistency of available demographic identifiers. While prior work has considered the impact of *missing* data on fairness, little attention has been paid to the role of *delayed* demographic data. Delayed data, while eventually observed, might be missing at the critical point of monitoring and action -- and delays may be unequally distributed across groups in ways that distort disparity assessments. We characterize such impacts in healthcare, using electronic health records of over 5M patients across primary care practices in all 50 states. Our contributions are threefold: First, we document the high rate of race and ethnicity reporting delays in a healthcare setting and demonstrate widespread variation in rates at which demographics are reported across different groups. Second, through a set of retrospective analyses using real data, we find that such delays impact disparity assessments and hence conclusions made across a range of consequential healthcare outcomes, particularly at more granular levels of state-level and practice-level assessments. Third, we find limited ability of conventional methods that impute missing race in mitigating the effects of reporting delays on the accuracy of timely disparity assessments. Our insights and methods generalize to many other high-stakes domains where delays in the availability of sensitive information may lead to biased and inaccurate audits.","Jennah Gosciak, Aparna Balagopalan, Derek Ouyang, Allison Koenecke, Marzyeh Ghassemi, Daniel E.

Language proficiency plays an important role in the school career of children. Therefore, it is important to understand which factors contribute to the language proficiency of these children. Besides formal education, exposure to the language plays an important role. Children not only get exposed to a language via their parents, but the entire social network plays a role. This study looks at children for which both parents are migrants (born outside of the Netherlands). For this the final test results of children in the 8th grade of primary school are used. This is the final grade of primary school (the children are then around 12 years old) and in principle all children are tested. The children are tested separately for spelling and grammar and for reading proficiency. Using the Persons Network of the Netherlands the isolation of each child are calculated. The Persons Network contains family members, household members, neighbours, co-workers and class mates for each person in the Netherlands. The isolation measures the extent to which the local network around a person, the ego network, consists of persons with the same migration background. The ego network contains all persons in the Netherlands. Using a localised random walk each person is assigned a weight which measured how easy it is to reach this person from the ego. Using ordinal regression the effect of both isolation and other possibly confounding variables such as the educational levels of both parents and household income were investigated. Furthermore, the total final exam score is added to the models. This leads to an overcorrection as this test result also includes language proficiency, but ensures that we can be quite sure that there are no unknown confounders remaining. From the regressions we can conclude that, the higher the share of persons with the same migrant background in the network of these children, the lower they score on the language components of the final exam of the 8th grade of the primary school (around the age of 12). For both 'reading' and 'spelling and grammar' this effect remains when we correct for socio-economic background and other personal characteristics known to correlate with language and learning proficiency. For 'reading' the effect also remains when we add the final exam score to the model. The effect of the network is no longer significant for 'spelling and grammar' when we add the final exam score. However, this is a very conservative model as the language tests are part of the final exam score. Overall, there seems to a clear indication for a network effect in language learning especially for 'reading'.","Dingeman Jan Van der Laan, Fijnanda van Klingeren, Marjolijn Das",Vingen 6,Inequality & Segregation II,1,,184

However, segregation across these domains is interconnected, and early-life circumstances shape long-term outcomes. This study investigates how various dimensions of segregation—including school segregation for children, neighborhood segregation, and workplace segregation among parents—jointly influence individuals’ life-course trajectories. By examining these overlapping experiences, we provide a comprehensive understanding of the cumulative effects of socio-economic segregation within households. While recent studies have leveraged mobility data to examine segregation beyond residential settings, these datasets often lack long-term socioeconomic and demographic details. To address this gap, we integrate two complementary approaches: (1) ""activity space segregation,"" which emphasizes that segregation extends beyond residence and into daily activities, and (2) life-course segregation studies, which highlight intergenerational continuities in exposure to affluence and poverty. Combining these insights, we assess whether exposure to concentrated affluence or poverty across multiple domains—neighborhoods, schools, and workplaces—reinforces long-term segregation patterns or allows for social mobility. This study examines individuals’ life-course exposure to affluence and poverty, termed ""exposure to income concentration"" (EIC), across multiple domains. We analyze whether and for whom EIC persists across settings, over the life course, and across generations. Using Swedish full-population data, we construct longitudinal EIC trajectories spanning 27 years in three key activity sites: neighborhoods, schools, and workplaces. Our analysis focuses on (1) socioeconomic disparities in EIC, (2) life-course associations in EIC across domains, and (3) the intergenerational transmission of EIC. Our findings reveal strong links between socioeconomic background and exposure to affluence or poverty across multiple domains and generations. We use Swedish administrative data to track one cohort—9th graders in 1990 (n = 109,406)—over 27 years, from age 16 to 42. Yearly exposure to two income groups—the top 20% (affluence) and the bottom 20% (poverty) of the household income rank distribution—is measured for neighborhoods, schools, and workplaces. The EIC for individual $i$ to income group $g$ in domain $d$ is calculated as: $EIC_{idgt} = \frac{n_{gdt} - 1_{i \in {gt}}}{n_{dt} - 1},$ where $1_{i \in g t}$ is an indicator variable equal to 1 if individual $i$ belongs to income group $g$ in year $t$, and 0 otherwise, and $n$ denotes count. $EIC_{idgt}$ ranges from 0 (no exposure) to 1 (full exposure). To compare EIC levels across domains, we compute cross-domain correlations, capturing individual-level correlations in EIC between domains over time. Additionally, we apply sequence analysis and group-based trajectory modeling to classify life-course EIC trajectories. Finally, we conduct rank-rank regressions to examine intergenerational transmission of EIC. Our findings reveal substantial socioeconomic inequalities in exposure. Individuals experiencing poverty or affluence in one domain often encounter similar conditions in others. The strongest correlations occur between neighborhoods and schools, while associations are weaker for workplaces and universities. Socioeconomic background plays a pivotal role: children from high-income families consistently experience greater exposure to affluence throughout their lives. Examining intergenerational transmission, we find that children inherit not only their parents’ neighborhood contexts but also their exposure to affluence or poverty in schools and, to a lesser extent, workplaces. These associations are strongest in high-income settings, where the median income rank of children’s schools rises by 0.73 percentile for every percentile increase in their parents’ school rank. This pattern persists across all income groups, reinforcing the persistence of affluence and poverty across generations. Nonetheless, some individuals break these patterns. Approximately one-third of those from the lowest-income backgrounds successfully transition into affluent settings.

While prior research has examined opinion leaders and viral content, less attention has been given to the interaction between framing strategies—diagnostic, prognostic, and motivational—and social ties—weak and strong ties—in mobilization processes. Using a large-scale dataset of Black Lives Matter (BLM) social media interactions from May 2020 to May 2021, we apply sentiment analysis, social network analysis, and diffusion modeling to analyze how different framing strategies propagate through weak and strong ties. Posts are classified into six emotions (anger, fear, sadness, joy, surprise, trust), with intensity levels assessed to examine their role in mobilization. Results reveal a two-phase diffusion process: (1) Early mobilization is driven by weak ties, where diagnostic and prognostic messages spread across loosely connected clusters, raising awareness and distributing proposed solutions. (2) Sustained engagement occurs within strong-tie networks, where motivational messages reinforce commitment and drive participation. Moreover, this research find that structural influence outperforms follower-based influence, as movement-focused alternative media, independent journalists, and activist networks play a more central role in shaping discourse than traditional celebrities or politicians. This study advances computational social science by integrating framing theory, network theory, and computational modeling to provide a structured understanding of how online movements scale. The findings contribute to political communication and network science by demonstrating how framing strategies interact with social ties to drive large-scale mobilization.","Huanrui Chen, Zhao Wang",Vingen 6,Inequality & Segregation II,3,,929

Compared to numerical time series, research shows that categorical sequence data are inherently more complex, requiring specialized techniques to analyze transitions, timing, and patterns. However, existing tools, such as R’s TraMineR, face computational inefficiencies that limit their applicability to large-scale datasets. We introduce Sequenzo, a Python package designed for fast, scalable, and user-friendly sequence analysis. It implements standard methods such as optimal matching and hierarchical clustering, but with parallelized dynamic programming and vectorized computation, significantly reducing memory overhead and achieving more than 10 times of speed improvements over TraMineR while maintaining analytical accuracy. Moreover, we call for extending the applications of SA from sociology and demography to economics, management, public health, and history. Potential research directions can be using sequence analysis to track regional innovation, model disease progression, and map institutional transformations.","Yuqi Liang, Xinyi Li, Jan Heinrich Ernst Meyerhoff-Liang",Vingen 6,Inequality & Segregation II,4,,219

2025-07-23 11:00:00,2025-07-23 12:30:00,session_presentation,Quantifying individualism in the long term (550-2000),"Study 1: Name Uniqueness Across the World (1500-2000) This study examines the historical evolution of individualism using 'name uniqueness'—the distinctiveness of first names within a society—as a well-established proxy for individualism. To compute the ""Name Uniqueness Score,"" we divide the frequency of a specific name in a given time period by the total number of names recorded during that period (Bao et al., 2021), and then average the uniqueness scores of all names to obtain a singular uniqueness score for the entire time period (a year or a decade). Leveraging a comprehensive dataset of 2,313,713 historical individuals from Wikidata, the analysis quantifies name uniqueness from 1500 to 2000 (Fan et al., 2024). The uneven distribution of available data across different time periods is a common challenge in quantitative history. To address this issue, we developed a bootstrapping technique. By resampling the data within each period, we create a balanced sample across a very long time period (see Figure 1). To validate this new method and new dataset, we cross-correlated our results with data from previous study (Mignot, 2022), which used other name metrics such as percentage of top 10 most common names and number of distinctive names, which are based on full sample name register. The cross-correlation result ranged from r = .59 to .95 for females and from r = .42 to .84 for males (see Figures 2A and 2B, for Figures 2C and 2D, Pearson’s correlation resulted in r = .71 for males and r = .85 for females, p < .001). We also correlated our results with survey-measured individualism (b = 0.33, p = 0.038; see Figure 3). These tests confirm that our bootstrapped name uniqueness is a reliable proxy for individualism. Our main analysis revealed that, controlling for year, name uniqueness tends to increase as GDP per capita grows (β = 0.26, p < 0.001, R² = 0.75; see Figure 4 and Table 1 for random intercept model and Table 2 for random slope model). To further solidify our findings, we conducted a series of robustness tests. We calculated name uniqueness based on occupation (β = 0.26, p < 0.001, R² = 0.70; see Figure 5 and Table 3) and gender (β = 0.23, p < 0.001, R² = 0.66; see Figure 6 and Table 4), we tested a more balanced sample with all countries from 1850-2000, where both GDP per capita and name uniqueness data are consistently available (β = 0.24, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.77, see Table 5 and 6). And we also tested fixed effect model (β = 0.33, p < 0.001, R2 = 0.67, see Table 7). These tests produced consistent results, demonstrating the reliability of our study. In this first study, we developed a new method for handling data limitations in historical records. Using this method, we quantified name uniqueness across different cultures for over 500 years and found a correlation with economic development. Study 2: Name Uniqueness Within Imperial China (550-1880) Individualism, characterized by autonomy, independence, and self-expression, is typically seen as a modern and Western phenomenon. Cultural historians, however, have pointed out that its roots extend much further into the past (Brindley, 2010; Hinsch, 2015). In this paper, we delve deeper in time to quantify the rise of individualism in a collectivist country. We used data from the China Biographical Database (Harvard University et al., 2024), which spans 1,500 years of Chinese history (540-1880 CE, N = 641,568). The CBDB documents the source material from which the individual is recorded from, enabling us to calculate name uniqueness based on individual biographies. This approach allows us to control for selection bias in each biographic record, enhancing the accuracy of our analysis. We observe a long-term increase in name uniqueness. Our analysis reveals that this general increase parallels the economic development and modernization of China throughout the Imperial period. We showed that name uniqueness scores significantly increased over time (β = 0.11, p < 0.001, R² = 0.550; see Figure 7 and Table 8). A similar trend is observed within the country, where the economically advanced Yangtze River Delta exhibits consistently higher levels of name uniqueness compared to less developed regions (β = 0.10, p < 0.001, R² = 0.618; see Figure 8 and Table 9). Finally, we observe a decline in name uniqueness during the late Qing dynasty, coinciding with a period of economic crisis (Quadratic term β = -0.01, p = 0.017, see Figure 9 and Table 10). We also conducted robustness tests using another database (N = 1,247,751) covering the periods 1760-1798, confirming that the decline in name uniqueness coincides with economic crisis. Our findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of cultural evolution in China and challenge long-held assumptions about the immutability of Chinese culture.","Zhaolun Fan, Valentin Thouzeau, Ying Zhong, Coralie Chevallier, Nicolas Baumard",Vingen 6,Sociology of culture,1,,300

However, several scholars argue that this body of knowledge, which underlies our understanding of everyday life, is socially distributed, i.e., possessed differently by different individuals in a society. Recent evidence further shows that humans vary enormously in their belief even about the simplest matters, suggesting that common sense is paradoxically “uncommon”. This previous work demonstrates how commonsensicality scores1 can be empirically analyzed via shared agreement among people of a population. However, its findings are heavily limited to the original pool of participants, who are English speakers predominantly residing in the U.S. It leaves open several important questions, most importantly whether this heterogeneity in belief is observed cross-culturally, spanning demographic and linguistic groups.","Mark E.

In particular, geographical locations are unequally portrayed in media, creating a distorted representation of the world. Identifying and measuring such biases is crucial to understand both the data and the socio-cultural processes that have produced them. Here we suggest to measure geographical biases in a large historical news media corpus by studying the representation of cities. Leveraging ideas of quantitative urban science, we develop a mixed quantitative-qualitative procedure, which allows us to get robust quantitative estimates of the biases. These biases can be further qualitatively interpreted resulting in a hermeneutic feedback loop. We apply this procedure to a corpus of the Soviet newsreel series ’Novosti Dnya’ (News of the Day) and show that city representation grows super-linearly with city size, and is further biased by city specialization and geographical location. This allows to systematically identify geographical regions which are explicitly or sneakily emphasized by Soviet propaganda and quantify their importance.","Mikhail Tamm, Mila Oiva, Maximilian Schich, Mark Mets, Ksenia Mukhina",Vingen 6,Sociology of culture,4,,761

We examined whether these foundational, ostensibly non-political behaviors are nevertheless bifurcated along political fault lines, revealing “lifestyle polarization.” In Study 1, we quantified the association between political identity and 61 social, movement, work, and leisure behaviors collected from smartphone sensors and logs (i.e., GPS, microphone, calling, texting, unlocks, activity recognition) and ecological momentary assessments (i.e., querying activity level, activity type, interaction partners, locations) at multiple temporal levels (i.e., daily, mornings, afternoon, evenings, nights, weekends, weekdays) in a sample of up to 1,229 young adults on a college campus. We found that liberals and conservatives behave differently in everyday life; the behavioral differences were small but robust, not accounted for by other plausible factors (e.g., demographics), and most pronounced in the leisure domain. Study 2 showed that these behavioral differences between liberals and conservatives were not accurately discerned by other members of the community, who overestimated the extent of lifestyle polarization present on campus. Together, these studies suggest that political identity has penetrated some of the most foundational aspects of everyday life, but not to the degree that people assume. We discuss how social life may feel divided not only because of deep ideological disagreements across partisan lines but also because such disagreements are accompanied by distinct lifestyles—both real and (mis)perceived—that may prevent liberals and conservatives from engaging in cross-partisan contact and developing mutual understanding.","Sanaz Talaifar, Diana Jordan, Samuel Gosling, Gabriella Harari",Vingen 6,Sociology of culture,5,,10

Second, we apply clustering techniques to identify visual prototypes and analyze their emergence across different concepts.

This paper identifies three trade-offs challenging the diffusion of conventions and explores each of them empirically using inverse problems motivated by game theory and statistical physics. The first trade-off (I) concerns the imperatives of social, sequential, and contextual consistency that individuals must balance when choosing between competing conventions. The second trade-off (II) involves the balance between local and global coordination, depending on whether individuals coordinate their behavior via interactions throughout a social network or external factors transcending the network. The third trade-off (III) is the balance between decision optimality (e.g., collective satisfaction) and decision costs when collectives with conflicting preferences choose a convention. A novel and broadly applicable statistical physics framework for measuring each of these trade-offs is proposed and applied to a sign convention in physics using textual and network data. The method can reveal the networks and processes through which conventions propagate. This work shows that the purpose of conventions may exceed coordination, and that individual preferences towards conventions are concurrently shaped by cultural factors and multiple social networks. Additionally, it reveals the role of leadership in the resolution of conflicts within collaborations. Finally, this contribution achieves a novel interface between statistical physics and simulation-based inference for empirical analyses of agent-based models of social systems.",Lucas Gautheron,Vingen 6,Cultural Dynamics,2,,307

This approach not only uncovers underlying scaling laws and long-range correlations in conflict dynamics but also aligns well with historical case studies, offering a powerful alternative to traditional heuristic methods.

2025-07-23 14:30:00,2025-07-23 16:00:00,session_presentation,The evolution of trends in Fashion,"The global fashion industry, valued at approximately \$1.81 trillion in 2021 [1], is a cornerstone of the modern economy, driving innovation, employment, and commerce across design, manufacturing, marketing, and retail sectors. Beyond its economic significance, fashion is a pervasive cultural phenomenon, deeply embedded in human society as one of the ten cultural universals. Clothing transcends mere utility, serving as a dynamic medium for expressing identity, social status, and cultural heritage. Every individual engages with this practice—whether by embracing or rejecting trends—making fashion an inescapable form of non-verbal communication that reflects societal values, historical shifts, and technological progress. Understanding the evolution of fashion offers a unique lens into human behavior and cultural dynamics. Trends in styles, colors, and silhouettes do not emerge in isolation; they mirror broader social structures, artistic movements, and technological advancements [2]. By leveraging computational methods, this study investigates how fashion trends evolve over time, revealing patterns of innovation, diversity, and influence across decades of runway collections. \textbf{Data:} Our analysis draws on a rich dataset of 954,000 runway looks spanning 1988 to 2025, encompassing 27,000 fashion show collections from 1,800 brands worldwide. This comprehensive corpus captures over three decades of high-fashion evolution, providing an unparalleled resource for tracing the interplay between creativity and culture in runway design. \textbf{Methods:} To systematically analyze this dataset, we employ a multi-stage computational pipeline integrating computer vision, natural language processing, and topic modeling. First, we preprocess images by removing backgrounds using the RMBG-2.0 model, isolating garment details for subsequent analysis (Fig. 1a-b) [3]. Next, we jointly embed images and their textual descriptions into a high-dimensional latent space using FashionCLIP (for visual features) and all-MiniLM-L12-v2 (for textual features),text description by the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model for robust multimodal alignment [4]. This embedding captures both visual and semantic dimensions of fashion runway looks. We then adapt BERTopic, a hierarchical topic modeling framework, to decompose these embeddings into granular topics at the token level (e.g., “white dress,” “polka dots,” “asymmetric hem”). Each look is represented as a composite of multiple topics, reflecting the layered complexity of fashion design (Fig. 1c). To validate this pipeline, we benchmark our approach against the Fashionpedia dataset, which includes 48,000 annotated fashion images with segmentation masks and fine-grained attributes (27 apparel categories, 19 apparel parts, 294 attributes) [5]. This validation ensures the accuracy of our topic extraction and embedding process. Finally, we quantify innovation and diversity in fashion trends using two complementary metrics: Richness (the number of distinct topics per brand or collection) and Shannon Style Entropy (a measure of topic distribution uniformity). We also apply an innovation diffusion model to assess novelty in styles, colors, and silhouettes over time, tracking how trends emerge, propagate, and fade across brands and seasons. This approach enables us to map the cultural evolution of fashion and identify drivers of change at both micro (brand-level) and macro (industry-level) scales. \textbf{Premilinary Results:} Preliminary findings demonstrate that our multimodal embeddings effectively Capture structural patterns in fashion shows, distinguishing between types (e.g., Menswear, Couture, Ready-to-Wear; Fig. 2a) and seasonal variations (e.g., Spring/Summer vs. Fall/Winter; Fig. 2b). These results validate the robustness of our embedding space as a representation of fashion’s multidimensional nature. We anticipate several key insights from the full analysis. First, we expect to uncover cycles of innovation, where periods of high Richness and Entropy signal bursts of creativity (e.g., the avant-garde movements of the 1990s or the sustainability-driven shifts of the 2020s), followed by consolidation phases with lower diversity. Second, we hypothesize that influential brands (e.g., Chanel, Prada) exhibit higher topic Richness and act as trendsetters, with their innovations diffusing to smaller labels over subsequent seasons.\\ This study bridges computational social science and cultural analysis, offering a scalable framework to decode the dynamics of fashion as a mirror of human society. By quantifying trends and innovation over decades, we contribute to a deeper understanding of how cultural artifacts evolve, diffuse, and reflect broader social forces—an endeavor with implications for historians, designers, and social scientists alike.","Katharina Ledebur, Sagar Kumar, August Lohse, Karolina Sliwa, Louis Boucherie",Vingen 6,Cultural Dynamics,5,,780

This study analyzes the lyrical trends of Vocaloid and human-performed songs from 2008 to 2023, focusing on topic distribution and temporal changes. Using BERTopic for topic modeling and a large language model (LLM) for topic labeling, we examined 800 Vocaloid songs from Niconico Video and 796 human-performed songs from the Billboard Japan Year-End charts. The results reveal that Vocaloid lyrics frequently contain negative themes, such as “lie” and “fool,” while human lyrics emphasize romantic and optimistic themes. Additionally, human lyrics exhibit greater fluctuations over time, particularly in response to social events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings highlight the distinct evolution of lyrics between Vocaloid and human singers, emphasizing the role of computational technologies in shaping modern music culture.

We investigate how individuals perceive the social structure around them. Social networks are crucial for social coordination and the diffusion of health-related, economic, and political phenomena. Social network research has focused on the social consequences of social structure, and work on social cognition has largely focused on how people represent the attributes of other people rather than of structure. Yet, network cognition in remains underexplored. The ability to accurately “see” one’s social network may facilitate individual and collective action. Humans possess a coalitional psychology. Beliefs about relationships are likely crucial mechanisms by which people form alliances, infer trustworthiness, or assign status. This may be especially important in settings with weak or absent formal institutions, such as the developing world. While social theorists have supposed individuals have little knowledge of their broader social world, a few have argued that mental representations of networks are important to understand social dynamics. Yet, empirical evidence has been limited. Work has examined cognition of social networks in the laboratory or very small networks in circumscribed settings.

While negativity bias can distort public perceptions, it is often considered less concerning than misinformation, even though mainstream media exposure far surpasses that of outright false information. Despite the emphasis on factual accuracy, mainstream media exhibits bias through selective topic highlighting and narrative framing. Although substantial research exists on media bias and its impacts, most studies on framing bias are limited in scope. To address this gap, our study introduces a framework employing large language models (LLMs) to explore selection and framing bias comprehensively. This innovative methodology generates synthetic articles from actual news facts and quotes, varying fact selection and presentation tone. Our randomized survey experiment reveals that biased presentation of accurate facts can significantly influence readers' opinions, with negative framing being particularly potent, especially among less informed individuals. The study suggests that misinformation is not essential to shape public opinion; instead, the selective presentation of truthful information suffices. This concern is amplified by the prevalent negativity bias in media, which may contribute to negative perceptions of the economy, political figures, and institutions. We advocate for a more comprehensive approach that not only considers misinformation but also examines biased yet factually correct reporting practices in mainstream media.","Amir Tohidi Kalorazi, Samar Haider, David Rothschild, Duncan J.

Here, we investigate the potential of using open-ended, self-described identity responses, combined with modern language modeling techniques, to capture more granular and contextually relevant insights into individuals’ identities. We collect, and will make publicly available, the ""In Your Own Words"" dataset which includes free-text identity descriptions from 1,000 respondents. Alongside these open-ended responses, the dataset contains categorical identity measures and life outcome variables, such as health, life satisfaction, and experiences with discrimination. Our analysis reveals that free-text identity clusters do not fully align with Census categories, demonstrating heterogeneity within and across identity groups. Furthermore, regression analyses indicate that incorporating free-text identity clusters improves predictions of key life outcomes––such as mental health, life satisfaction, and perceptions of discrimination––beyond using categorical data alone. However, this predictive gain is observed primarily for gender and sexual orientation, with race-based free-text clusters providing limited additional explanatory power. Overall, our results demonstrate that free-text data, when analyzed with LLMs, enhances the quantitative study of identity by combining the nuance of qualitative responses with the scalability of computational methods.

We propose to instantiate LLMs with open-ended text from human participants and use them to infer the relevant parameters of a belief-dynamics model. This drastically reduces the burden on participants to provide numerous explicit ratings of nodes and links in their belief network, and it allows them to highlight the beliefs that are salient to them personally.

Overconfidence can be broadly defined as a bias that makes people have a subjective assessment of their own aptitude that is greater than their objective accuracy of such aptitude. A well-studied example concerns the Dunning-Kruger effect, which posits that the least knowledgeable are more likely to overestimate their skills, an effect that has been linked to particularly consequential aspects of scientific knowledge, such as vaccine hesitancy and opposition to genetically modified foods. Since the publication of the original Dunning–Krueger effect, the field has accumulated a large body of evidence and evolved to suggest a more nuanced pattern than the original proposal. For example, several studies indicate that the main tenet of the effect—that the unskilled are unaware of their lack of skill—might not be universal. Moreover, gauging confidence or knowledge is not trivial: no metrics are perfect and might not be universal or even independent. For example, measures to gauge confidence often rely on self-reporting (e.g., participants are asked how well they believe they performed on a given task), and this can introduce important biases, such as desirability bias. In the current study, we applied a computational approach to three large-scale surveys (Eurobarometer, General Social Survey, Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel) and two academic datasets, spanning 30 years in Europe and the USA and involving over 95.000 participants. This large dataset allowed us to introduce both analytical and methodological changes to the study of (over)confidence in science knowledge and in attitudes towards science. First, we propose a new indirect confidence metric that does not rely on self-reporting or peer comparison, requiring only that study participants are given the opportunity to provide a “Don’t know” answer. The rationale of this measure is that, when asked a scientific knowledge question, participants who know the answer should answer correctly, participants who do not should answer “Don’t know”, while an incorrect answer can be interpreted as an overestimation of one’s knowledge (participants think they know, when they don’t). In this case, overconfidence is calculated as the proportion of incorrect answers out of all non-correct answers. Agent-based simulations are then used to account for the fact that, if at least some of the incorrect answers are the result of guessing, we should expect a higher level of incorrect answers in higher knowledge scores, as guessers’ scores are inflated, in comparison with people who do not guess, by the fact they sometimes get the correct answer by chance. Second, due to our large samples, we achieve very reliable estimates of the confidence of participants at the tails of the knowledge distribution and can study how knowledge and confidence vary across their full scale, avoiding the common quartile aggregation which may hide important variation. Third, we compare our new indirect metric with more traditional confidence metrics (e.g., how well-informed participants believe themselves to be or how many items they believed they answered correctly). Fourth, using the Eurobarometer dataset, we investigate how overconfidence covaries with negative attitudes towards science, assessed through participants’ agreement with a set of statements. Results revealed that: 1) confidence grows much faster than knowledge, but 2) this growth is non-linear, with the largest confidence gaps at intermediate to high knowledge levels, not the lowest levels as the Dunning-Kruger effect would predict; 3) this effect is robust across confidence metrics, and 4) the least positive attitudes towards science are found for these high-confidence / intermediate-knowledge groups, not the lowest levels as many science communication models hold when they propose that what is needed to improve attitude towards science is more knowledge of science. Thus, our results indicate that the least knowledgeable show at least some evidence of good metacognition, but that individuals with some knowledge (which are also the most frequent in our surveyed populations) are the most likely to overestimate it and to have less-positive attitudes towards science. This study is thus a good example of the importance of large-scale surveys and how they can be combined with agent-based modelling to generate clear implications for current science communication strategies, as providing incomplete or oversimplified information may backfire by offering more confidence than knowledge. Together, our work suggests that, at least in the case of scientific topics, some knowledge is more dangerous than little knowledge, and it is fundamental to develop multidisciplinary approaches, building from psychology, social media, and complex systems analysis, to avoid such dangers.","Simone Lackner, Frederico Francisco, Cristina Mendonça, André Mata, Joana G Sa",Troselli,Computational Psychology,6,,991

The results showed a significant reduction in two target outcomes - views of offensive posts and comments - in the treatment group compared to the control group. However, we did not observe significant effects of the intervention on the thirteen other outcomes measured between groups.

This study evaluates the effectiveness of empathy-based counterspeech delivered by Nigerian celebrities in reducing hate content on Twitter. In a randomized controlled experiment, 63,550 users with a history of engaging in hate speech were assessed, with 31,685 randomly assigned to receive a short, pro-social video message via Twitter Ads from December 2023 to May 2024. We measured both overall user engagement and hate-related activity, over pre-treatment, during-treatment, and post-treatment periods. Findings reveal a 5.1% reduction in overall platform activity and a 3.2% reduction in hate speech during the intervention, with effects persisting up to three months after the campaign ended. These results highlight the promise of counterspeech as a non-invasive, cost-effective alternative to content-moderation as a punitive measure in combating online hate speech, though they also raise questions about potential impacts on user engagement.","Eaman Jahani, Blas Kolic, Hause Lin, Manuel Tonneau, dnlbrkc, Niyati Malhotra, Victor Orozco-Olvera, Samuel Fraiberger",Vingen 8,Experiments,3,,1021

Should we expect player-driven changes to the ”rules of the game” to ben- efit cooperation, as agents tweak their environment toward non-zero-sum games — or hinder it because of the challenges of constant change? We introduce a laboratory setting to test whether groups can guide themselves to cooperative outcomes by manipulating the strategic environment that structures their interactions. By offering players “first-order” choices within an economic game (agency over behavior) along with “second-order” choices between games (agency over the rules of the game), we understand emergent cooperation in naturalistic settings in which the rules of the game are themselves dynamic and subject to choice.","Qiankun Zhong, Nori Jacoby, Ofer Tchernichovski, Seth Frey",Vingen 8,Experiments,4,,715

Although a large body of evidence shows that groups can exhibit performance advantages, the specific conditions under which they do so remain unclear. Here, we define group advantage as the performance gain due to group interaction relative to an equivalent number of individuals working independently. Through an integrative experiment using a 24-dimensional “Task Space” that quantifies task attributes, we sampled 20 diverse tasks at three complexity levels, randomly assigning participants to work individually or in groups of three or six — resulting in 5,972 observations across 180 unique experimental conditions. Our results reveal striking heterogeneity in group advantage, with outcomes ranging from one third as good as to 1.6 times better than the best individual, depending on the task context. To characterize these patterns, we developed predictive models using task dimensions that significantly outperformed traditional approaches based on task types or group composition characteristics. Demonstrable correctness emerged as the most predictive feature, followed by creative requirements; however, these features interact in important ways — for example, the benefit of creativity depends critically on whether the task has demonstrably correct answers. Our results refocus the debate from whether groups “work better” to the specific conditions under which they do and do not work, while demonstrating how integrative experiments combined with machine learning can uncover generalizable patterns. We generate predictions for an additional 420 yet-unseen experimental conditions, inviting further research to test and refine our model.","Mark E. Whiting, Xinlan Emily Hu, Duncan J.

Uncertainty about the distribution of social preferences can explain first round contributions, but not the variance of contribution patterns in repeated play. Using a large-scale dataset (50,390 observations from 2,938 participants) we address this gap with two methodological contributions. First we propose a clustering approach (dynamic time warping) that reflects the nature of the data: it is two-dimensional, relating choices to experiences; and it allows changes to occur at idiosyncratic points of time. Second we refrain from constraining dynamic reactions to predictions derived from static social preferences. Instead, we treat reward function design as an estimation problem, using Inverse Reinforcement Learning to model behavioral patterns as discrete switches between latent intentions. This approach reveals that apparently noisy behavior in social dilemmas can be systematically explained as fluctuations between distinct latent intentions. Our framework successfully accounts for behavioral patterns previously categorized as noise, providing a new paradigm for understanding dynamic decision-making in social dilemma games.","Carina I Hausladen, Marcel H Schubert, Christoph Engel",Vingen 8,Experiments,6,,694

Understanding the factors that influence the formation of these habits is crucial for developing effective interventions. This study utilizes data from Mars Athletic Club, Türkiye's largest sports chain, to investigate the dynamics of gym attendance and habit formation. The general problem addressed by this study is identifying the critical periods and factors that contribute to the successful establishment of consistent exercise routines among gym-goers. Here we show that there are specific periods during which gym attendance is most crucial for habit formation. By developing a survival metric based on gym attendance patterns, we pinpoint these critical periods and segment members into distinct clusters based on their visit patterns. Our analysis reveals significant differences in how various subgroups respond to interventions, such as group classes, personal trainer sessions, and visiting different clubs. Using causal inference analysis, we demonstrate that personalized guidance and social dynamics are key drivers of sustained long-term engagement. By systematically examining these variables and considering the specific characteristics of different clusters, our research demonstrates the importance of a tailored, multi-dimensional approach to promoting exercise habits, which integrates social dynamics, personalized guidance, and strategic interventions to sustain long-term engagement.","Onur Varol, Ege Demirci, Efe Tüzün, Ahmet Furkan Ün, taners",Vingen 7,Health & Quality of Life I,2,,83

Our mixed-methods approach responds to this challenge by developing a set of themes focused on risk factors for suicide mortality in online digital spaces and a framework to model these themes at scale. One of the persistent challenges in understanding the effects of social media on mental health outcomes is the lack of context of social media experiences, given the tendency for scientists to measure social media exposure relative to time spent online versus the content or interactions in the online space. To fill this gap, we identified 13 specific experiences within social media that were considered by law enforcement, the medical examiner, family or friends to be relevant in contexualizing a given adolescent’s death.

2025-07-24 11:00:00,2025-07-24 12:30:00,session_presentation,Stress Bytes: Decoding the Associations between Internet Use and Perceived Stress,"Stress is a fundamental aspect of human existence and a contributor to various physical and mental health conditions. Traditionally, stress has been associated with major life events; however, everyday experiences also trigger physiological responses that can lead to strain. In today's digital age, the internet plays an increasingly influential role in shaping our daily experiences through communication, work, education, and leisure. Despite its pervasive influence, research on stress and psychological well-being has predominantly focused on offline activities, overlooking the potential impact of online behaviors on stress and well-being. Additionally, existing studies on online engagement often suffer from limitations such as short study durations, small sample sizes, and an over-reliance on self-reported internet use data, which may introduce biases and obscure the complete picture of the connection between online and offline experiences. To address this gap, we conducted a longitudinal multimodal study involving 1,490 German participants over a span of seven months. Our study combined fine-grained, passively observed web browsing traces from desktops and mobiles of the study participants with monthly questionnaires containing validated psychological scales (Perceived Stress Scale, PSS-10). By utilizing fine-grained, actual behavioral data, our study goes beyond subjective self-reports on internet use to establish a data-driven framework for identifying behavioral markers of stress in individuals' internet use. We employed linear mixed-effects models, which are well-suited for longitudinal data as they account for repeated measurements and both fixed and random effects. We examined three dimensions of internet use: (i) volume, (ii) temporal, and (iii) semantic browsing volume. Socio-demographic variables (e.g., gender, age, income) and survey wave effects (to account for seasonal variations in stress) were controlled for in each model. The relationship between internet use and stress varies by how, (behavioral patterns), where (contextual factors), when (temporal factors), and by whom (individual differences) the internet is used. Our research adopts a structured approach to explore these dimensions comprehensively. First, we analyze how internet use behaviors—such as volume, timing, and content categories (e.g., social media, work, entertainment)—relate to stress. This establishes which activities contribute to or alleviate stress. Next, we explore ‘where’ digital engagement occurs, comparing structured (desktop) versus fragmented (mobile) interactions that influence stress. We then examine short-term digital behaviors within two days of stress evaluations to identify immediate behavior. Finally, we explore individual differences, considering factors like age, gender, income, and baseline stress. This helps determine which groups are more susceptible to stress-related digital behaviors, enhancing our understanding of digital well-being. Our findings identify distinct stress-related patterns in internet use. While total online time is not significantly associated with stress, how that time is used matters. Among mobile users, higher engagement with shopping platforms is linked to increased stress ( = 0.04, p = 0.035), while work-related internet use is associated with reduced stress ( = -0.03, p = 0.042). Contextually, mobile-based behaviors show a stronger link to stress than desktop use, highlighting how device interaction influences stress levels. Temporally, short-term analysis suggests that certain activities, like news consumption, may help mitigate stress. Finally, individual differences reveal that younger individuals, women, and lower-income groups experience higher stress levels. For highly stressed individuals, more time online--especially on social media and gaming via mobile devices--is linked with increased stress. In this group, income is the only significant socio-demographic predictor of stress, with age and gender showing no notable effects. Our study highlights the importance of a detailed analysis of internet usage, demonstrating how a data-driven approach, combined with online questionnaires, can uncover the nuanced relationship between digital behavior and stress. By analyzing how, when, where, and by whom the internet is used, we provide a layered understanding of these associations, moving from broad patterns to contextual and temporal influences, and finally to individual differences. Thus, our research offers a scalable framework for analyzing digital behavior as a marker for well-being factors, including stress, presenting a robust alternative to traditional self-reported measures. The insights gained can inform personalized tools for self-monitoring and managing online behaviors to reduce stress and promote digital well-being, contributing to global mental health initiatives.","MOHAMMAD BELAL, Nguyen Luong, Talayeh Aledavood, Juhi Kulshrestha",Vingen 7,Health & Quality of Life I,6,,714

Cognitive decline can be managed through cognitive-communication training and rehabilitation, yet the clinical tools currently available to target interventions and measure rehabilitation progress are often limited by tests based on non-representative normative data and non-functional measures that do not capture the naturalistic aspects of everyday conversation. Recent breakthroughs in automated transcription and Natural Language Processing provide the opportunity to extract detailed conversational features from large volumes of speech data and use these features to establish normative data against which subtle changes in communication can be measured. These advances enable automated analysis at a scale previously unattainable, establishing the feasibility of innovative diagnostic and treatment tools that are accessible, non-invasive, affordable, and standardized, and can preserve or improve quality of life. In this study, we leverage these computational advances and a large, diverse corpus of over 50,000 interview audio samples from the StoryCorps Archive to develop a machine learning classifier that can detect dementia using features of conversational structure and cohesion extracted from naturalistic speech.

Everyday language reveals our inner psychological states and personalities through unique word choices and sentence structures, forming a “linguistic fingerprint” that distinguishes individuals without exposing sensitive personal data. This intrinsic style enables novel approaches to tailoring communication, especially for adolescents, by enhancing personal relevance without compromising privacy. Recent research shows that mirroring an individual’s linguistic style can boost engagement, trust, and effectiveness in digital interactions, education, and interpersonal exchanges. However, most studies have focused on isolated language features (e.g., sentiment, formality), leaving a gap in understanding which linguistic dimensions truly drive these effects. Moreover, while message tailoring has been thoroughly studied, we currently do not understand the underyling mechansims of linguistic tailoring as a persuasion tool. This lack of understanding limits our ability to apply lingusitic tailoring effectively in computational communication (e.g., chatbots) or within social media campaigns. Research Aim: This study establishes a theoretical and practical foundation for psycholinguistic tailoring in persuasive health communication by investigating: Which psycholinguistic categories most effectively resonate with adolescents (RQ1), Whether messages matching their individual linguistic style enhance persuasiveness (RQ2), and The underlying mechanisms, including the effects on perceived personalization and message effectiveness (RQ3). Method. The experiment was conducted in four secondary schools in [COUNTRY] and involved 178 adolescents aged 12 to 14. To capture their authentic linguistic style, we collected a corpus of WhatsApp chats donated by the participants via a dedicated data donation software (mean word count per person = 7.976). These texts were analyzed using the well-established Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) tool (LIWC22; Boyd, 2022; Pennebaker, 2011), focusing on 19 LIWC categories that directly reflect psycholinguistic properties (see Table 1). After the linguistic scoring of our participants, we employed a dichotomous message choice task. Adolescents were presented with 19 pairs of health-promoting Instagram messages. In each pair, one message (the control) exhibited a low score (< 5) in a specific LIWC category, while its counterpart (the experimental message) had a high score (> 14) in that category. Participants were asked to choose their preferred message for each pair (see Figure 2). Importantly, the messages were carefully designed to be identical in meaning, syntax, and length, differing only in their psycholinguistic style. To assess the similarity between each message and a participant’s own linguistic style, we computed a standardized psycholinguistic similarity score for each LIWC category. This score, calculated as the difference between the LIWC score of the experimental message and that of the participant, ranges from 0 (extreme dissimilarity) to 1 (extreme similarity). Results/Discussion. Addressing our first research question, we ranked the 19 psycholinguistic categories from least to most popular within the message choice task (Table 1, Figure 1). The results reveal a clear preference for positive-valence styles: over 62% of adolescents favored health messages featuring words related to rewards or drive (e.g., achievement, striving), while only 25–33% preferred messages with negative-valence words (e.g., negative tone, negative emotion, lack) or messages with more complex, lengthy words. This pattern indicates a strong positivity bias in adolescents’ message preferences, independent of linguistic similarity. For our second research question, we employed a Bayesian multilevel logistic regression with psycholinguistic similarity as the main predictor and message choice as the dependent variable. The analysis showed that psycholinguistic similarity does not significantly predict message choice (b = –0.03, 95% CI [–0.18, 0.10]; BF₁₀ = 31.56), suggesting that adolescents do not generally prefer messages that mirror their own linguistic style across the 19 categories. Additional analyses examining potential mediating mechanisms further revealed that psycholinguistic similarity did not predict perceived personalization (b = –0.01, 95% CI [–0.02, 0.01]; BF₁₀ = 45.46) or perceived message effectiveness (b = –0.02, 95% CI [–0.13, 0.07]; BF₁₀ = 45.69). The robust Bayes Factors indicate that the data are far more likely under the null hypothesis, reinforcing the conclusion that psycholinguistic similarity has no meaningful impact on these outcomes.","Jonas Schlicht, Thabo J van Woudenberg",Vingen 7,Health & Quality of Life II,3,,760

We seek to answer whether vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals can be identified by their digital behaviour and aim to determine which types of online behaviour contribute the most to predicting COVID-19 vaccine uptake. To answer these questions, we predict the vaccination status of participants purely based on their digital footprints on Google, YouTube and Facebook and focus on the diverse importance of features to detect those online activities, along which vaccinated and not vaccinated individuals can be distinguished from each other. Social media can not only reflect but also shape people's offline behaviour, including health-related habits, such as diet, exercise, and smoking (Centola, 2013), as well as behaviors related to COVID-19 prevention (Al-Dmour et al., 2020). Alongside the peer effect, there are other possible influences of social media on behaviour (Sherman et al., 2016, 2018; Nesi & Prinstein, 2019; Vannucci et al., 2020). While social media can serve as a platform for spreading information about vaccination campaigns (Li et al., 2022), it can also pose risks to vaccination behavior (McKinley & Limbu, 2024; Wilson & Wiysonge, 2020). Those opposed to vaccination may be more exposed to misinformation (Pierri et al., 2022; Rathje et al., 2022), leading to the formation of opinion bubbles and echo chambers, which can further isolate anti-vaccination individuals in the online space (Rathje et al., 2022). In the current data donation study, nearly 800 Hungarian individuals have agreed to share their entire social media activity data stored about them by the platforms for research purposes, including Facebook, Google, YouTube and in some cases, smaller platforms (Instagram, TikTok). The sample of users is representative of the Hungarian internet user population by gender, age and region. The donation was accompanied by a detailed questionnaire that participants filled out. The survey included a number of health-related topics, including questions about COVID-19 vaccination status. For the prediction of vaccination status, digital behavioural indicators were created. Modelling was performed using a fine-tuned and cross-validated XGBoost model (Chen et al., 2015). The XGBoost model shows the effect of various digital and social media behaviours as features on the prediction of vaccination status. Key factors include Google searches and clicks on vaccine-related keywords, YouTube video consumption patterns, and Facebook reactions. For instance, higher engagement in vaccine-related Google searches and clicks is associated with a higher likelihood of vaccination. This suggests that individuals actively seeking information about vaccines may be more inclined to get vaccinated. YouTube search and viewing behaviour also plays a role. Individuals who search for or watch COVID-related YouTube content tend to have higher SHAP values, suggesting a positive relationship between information-seeking behaviour and vaccination uptake. Anti-vaccine Facebook comments are linked to lower vaccination likelihood, reinforcing the role of online misinformation or vaccine hesitancy narratives in shaping attitudes toward vaccination. Reactions on Facebook yielded mixed effects. “Haha” reactions (typically used to mock or express scepticism) are negatively associated with vaccination. Conversely, “Love” reactions show a positive association with vaccination, suggesting that individuals who positively engage with content on Facebook may be more likely to get vaccinated. Linguistic complexity in Facebook comments might reflect deeper cognitive engagement with the vaccine discourse but has a relatively minor impact. Overall, our analysis highlights how individuals’ online search behaviours, social media interactions, and engagement with vaccine-related content is associated with vaccination behaviour. The findings of this study have the potential to enhance our comprehension of vaccination behaviour thereby complementing the results of conventional research describing the social context of COVID-19 vaccination and more broadly vaccine refusal characteristics.

As concerns grew over mandated health measures, a loose collective formed on Twitter to assert autonomy over vaccination decisions. Using analyses of pronoun usage, outgroup labeling, and tweet similarity, we examine how this identity emerged. A turning point occurred following President Macron's announcement of mandatory vaccination for health workers and the health pass, sparking substantial changes in linguistic patterns. We observed a shift from first-person singular (*I*) to first-person plural (*we*) pronouns, alongside an increased focus on vaccinated individuals as a central outgroup, in addition to authority figures. This shift in language patterns was further reflected in the behavior of new users. An analysis of incoming users revealed that a core group of frequent posters played a crucial role in fostering cohesion and shaping norms. New users who joined during the week of Macron's announcement and continued posting afterward showed an increased similarity with the language of the core group, contributing to the crystallization of the emerging collective identity.","Melody Sepahpour-Fard, Michael Quayle, Pádraig MacCarron, Shane Mannion, Dong Nguyen",Vingen 7,Health & Quality of Life II,5,,840

Yet, this is not how other computational fields typically define themselves. Computational biology and computational neuroscience, for instance, are defined not by their tools but by the study of biology and the brain as computational systems. In fact, some of the biggest breakthroughs in these fields have come through theoretical efforts—e.g., mathematical models of cognition or through philosophical reasoning about the computational basis of evolution—whereas some of their biggest failures have come from an overreliance on flawed data-intensive measurement technologies and statistical techniques (e.g., spurious results from correlational modeling of cognitive function via fMRI). Lessons from these other fields consistently underscore the need to equally balance theory and empirics—a balance that is currently off-kilter in CSS. This talk will draw lessons from the history of computational biology and neuroscience for how CSS can begin to define itself at a foundational level as the study of society as a kind of computational system. I focus on two key lessons: (i) the need to accurately align constructs and variables through computational theory, and (ii) the need to characterize formal representations that define the ontology of social computation. The talk will additionally highlight ways in which theoretical CSS is poised to provide valuable insights into the nature of computation throughout the social and natural sciences.",Douglas Richard Guilbeault,Troselli,Theory & Methodology,1,,662
2025-07-22 11:00:00,2025-07-22 12:30:00,session_presentation,A Comparative Analysis of the use of Linear Models in Quantitative Social Sciences,"The literature shows that more than half of quantitative research in social sciences has relied on linear modeling techniques. Linear models focus on measuring the isolated effects of independent variables on outcomes, which often implies an additive conceptualization of the social phenomena. This particular analytically-oriented framework is different from others that conceptualize the social world in terms of configurations and processes where social factors correlate, change, vary, and evolve in tandem. Configurational and processual analysis frameworks often rely on statistical methods other than linear models (e.g., geometric data analysis techniques). We contribute an empirical analysis of the frequency of use of linear models in quantitative research across eight different disciplines using the publicly available OpenAlex database which has the most comprehensive coverage in comparison to proprietary databases. We found that linear models are used prevalently from 50% to 70% in Economics, Geography, Psychology, Political Sciences, and Sociology, with most of them displaying the highest prevalence of linear models use in the 2010s. This prevalence is lower in Environmental Sciences and History (i.e., around 40%), and much higher in Medicine (i.e., above 80%). Based on our results, awareness should be raised to motivate a greater diversity in analysis frameworks, especially among the scientific communities in the social sciences.","Andres CASTRO, Aliakbar Akbaritabar",Troselli,Theory & Methodology,2,,295

Yet text used to proxy an unobserved confounder often encodes aspects of the treatment itself, a problem called “treatment leakage.” When text includes these treatment signals, adjusting for that text risks conditioning on a post-treatment variable, thereby biasing causal estimates. Crucially, leakage can emerge even if the text was written before the treatment formally occurred, since language can anticipate or plan future actions.","Adel Daoud, Richard Johansson, Connor Thomas Jerzak",Troselli,Theory & Methodology,4,,792

2025-07-23 14:30:00,2025-07-23 16:00:00,session_presentation,The Day After: Network Dynamics of Rebel Alliances and Governance Institutions in Syria,"This study examines how wartime alliances and rivalries among rebel groups in Syria shaped local governance institutions. By integrating identity-based (Balcells, Chen, and Pischedda 2022; Bapat and Bond 2012; Corradi 2023; Topal 2024) and power-based (Christia 2012) explanations with network science, this project models the relational dynamics of rebel groups and their impact on Syria’s local governance structures. I hypothesize that rebel governing institutions reflect wartime power dynamics, with dominant factions shaping governance structures to preserve control rather than foster inclusivity. The findings demonstrate that Syria’s local governance structures remain fragmented, reinforcing factional divisions rather than enabling democratic flexibility. This study contributes to scholarship on post-conflict governance and offers insights into the long-term institutional legacies of civil war. I construct a network of Syrian rebel groups using alliances and defections (Gade, Hafez, and Gabbay 2019), and battles (Sundberg and Melander 2013) as well as rebel governance institutions (Albert 2022). Case comparisons allow for the assessment of rebel networks at different war stages, helping to determine how alliance dynamics correlate with governance structures in rebel-held territories. I incorporate a subnational case study design focusing on Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in Northwest Syria, ISIS in Raqqa, and the PYD in Northeast Syria. These cases provide contrasting governance models, shaped by distinct networked relationships during wartime. HTS, as a dominant yet fractured Islamist faction, has relied on selective coalition-building to consolidate control in Idlib, balancing between cooperation and coercion. ISIS, operating under a hegemonic structure, imposed a rigid bureaucratic system in Raqqa, relying on centralized authority rather than durable alliances. In contrast, the PYD in Rojava has established a decentralized governance structure through a network of alliances with various ethnic and ideological groups. For this analysis, I incorporate two forms of statistical modeling tailored for network data. Firstly, I implement an additive and multiplicative random effects model to examine patterns of alliances in Syria. Furthermore, I apply Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) to assess structural dependencies within the network and validate the observed patterns of cooperation and conflict. I propose that rebel relations influence post-conflict governance through two primary mechanisms. First, power composition plays a key role, as rebel groups differ in material capabilities such as manpower, expertise, and foreign support, shaping their relative power within an insurgency (Krause 2014). Power asymmetries influence whether coalitions produce hegemonic or inclusive institutions. Second, the density and stability of alliances determine whether wartime coalitions persist into post-war institutions Fragmented, unstable networks lead to elite-driven consolidation, while cohesive alliance structures facilitate broader inclusion (Furlan 2020; Mampilly and Stewart 2021). By identifying clusters of cooperation and patterns of exclusion, this study evaluates whether post-conflict governance structures are path-dependent on wartime alliances. The theoretical framework classifies wartime alliances along two dimensions: power composition (hegemonic versus balanced) and identity composition (homogeneous versus heterogeneous). These distinctions yield four potential post-war institutional outcomes: (1) Inclusive power-sharing in balanced, heterogeneous alliances, though often disrupted by spoilers; (2) Inclusive power-sharing in homogeneous alliances if unity is maintained, but fragmentation risks ongoing conflict; (3) Exclusive power-sharing in heterogeneous hegemonic alliances, where institutions primarily serve to entrench the dominant faction’s control; and (4) No institutional power-sharing in homogeneous hegemonic alliances, where the leading faction can govern unilaterally without coalition constraints. This research advances computational political science by demonstrating how networked relationships during war shape long-term governance outcomes. By integrating network analysis with conflict studies, this work provides insights into how rebel cooperation and competition influence state-building trajectories. By systematically analyzing the relational structures of Syrian rebel groups, it offers a novel perspective on the institutional legacies of war. Findings will inform broader discussions on governance in post-conflict societies and the role of wartime networks in shaping peace and political inclusion.",Betul Ozturan,Business meeting room,Hybrid Session,1,,879
2025-07-23 14:30:00,2025-07-23 16:00:00,session_presentation,Passive News Exposure and Active News Engagement in All-web Information Ecosystems,"News consumption lies at the heart of informed democratic citizenship, enabling individuals to participate meaningfully in civic life. Yet, as digital platforms increasingly mediate how people encounter and engage with news, understanding the interplay between algorithmic curation, user agency, and news quality has become critical to addressing democratic challenges such as polarization and misinformation. While traditional research equates news consumption with direct visits to news websites and focuses narrowly on individual platforms (e.g., Google, Facebook, or Twitter), this approach does not encompass the fragmented, multi-platform nature of the media ecosystem today. To address these limitations, we developed a browser extension that captures both passive news exposure (URLs visible within a users' browser viewport) as well as active news engagement (URLs the user clicked on). We deployed the extension in a three-week study of 851 US adults, collecting 3.9 million URL engagements and 67.9 million URL exposures. Analyzing the bias and reliability of the news URLs, we find that users encounter more – and more diverse – news than previously reported. Examining cross-platform differences reveal key patterns: search engines provide higher-quality news than social media, and compared to news websites, social media delivers content that is more ideologically congruent, more extreme and less reliable. Users generally engage with lower-quality news than they are exposed to, but the extent of this gap depends on the platform. Our findings challenge the narrative of declining news consumption by revealing significant disparities in news exposure across platforms and ideological groups. We emphasize the need to separate algorithmic curation from user-driven selective exposure and highlight the limitations of single-platform studies—e.g., search engines act as “balanced curators,” unlike social media’s reliability trade-offs.","Shengchun Huang, Stephanie Wang, Alvin Zhou, Danaé Metaxa",Business meeting room,Hybrid Session,2,,460
2025-07-23 14:30:00,2025-07-23 16:00:00,session_presentation,Evaluating Commonsense Knowledge in Human and Large Language Model-Simulated Populations,"Most conceptions of human common sense have centered around the notion of correctness: There is assumed to be an uncontested way in which we humans apprehend matters of everyday reality. Social scientists, however, believe that because people's subjective experiences are never identical, neither is their commonsense knowledge, which is synthesized from such experiences. Recent empirical research affirmatively shows that humans, indeed, are highly heterogeneous in their judgment of even seemingly obvious statements. In this work, we ask whether large language models (LLMs) can reflect, with high fidelity, this heterogeneity in human commonsense beliefs. We use every LLM (out of 34 models) to simulate a hypothetical society of ""silicon samples."" Each subject in this society is given a set of statements and asked to indicate whether (a) it agrees with the statement and (b) it believes most people would agree with that statement. Based on this signal, we calculate a *commonsensicality score* for every statement. If the population of silicon samples accurately represents humans in terms of their common sense, then the score of each statement should be roughly the same in both populations. The ""fidelity"" of a model, therefore, can be calculated as the Pearson correlation between these scores. We observe that most LLMs demonstrate a small to moderate association with humans in their judgment of statements, up to the $r = .43$ level. When examining these results further, most populations of silicon samples have the same qualitative tendencies as humans. However, there are some areas where we observe a divergence. For instance, Gemini Pro 1.0-generated samples tend to prefer statements that use a figure of speech than literal expressions, and they tend to agree with more abstract claims than descriptions of everyday, ordinary experiences. Our findings have important implications for the treatment of commonsense knowledge in various spheres, such as in artificial intelligence (AI), which tends to ignore human heterogeneity and assume that common sense has a ""correct label."" Our proposed measure offers a solution to such a problem where machine common sense is measured in terms of agreement with humans in a target population rather than accuracy to ground truth.","Josh Nguyen, Duncan J.

While large language models (LLMs) have been widely studied as aids for individuals, their potential to support groups of users, potentially as facilitators, is relatively underexplored. We present a pre-registered randomized experiment with 1,475 participants assigned to five-person groups completing a hidden profile task—selecting an optimal city for a hypothetical sporting event—under one of four facilitation conditions: no facilitation, a one-time message prompting information sharing, a human facilitator, or an LLM (GPT-4o) facilitator. We find that LLM facilitation increases information shared within a discussion by raising the minimum level of engagement with the task among group members, and that these gains come at limited cost in terms of participants' attitudes towards the task, their group, or their facilitator. However, despite improved information exchange, we find no significant effect of facilitation on the final decision outcome, suggesting that decision-making biases may still persist. To support further research into how LLM-based interfaces can support the future of collaborative work, we release our experimental platform, the Group-AI Interaction Laboratory (GRAIL), as an open-source tool.","David Rothschild, Mohammed Alsobay, Jake M.

We propose the Harm-Responsive Design Process to evaluate platform well-being strategies through social media news releases. Method: We collected all news releases related to digital well-being, safety, and privacy from Meta, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, and Twitter/X, totaling over 4,500 news releases. We developed an LLM-assisted content analysis pipeline with a codebook designed following the Harm-Responsive Design Process framework. The pipeline employs few-shot prompting for 15 content analysis tasks, including deductive classification, named entity recognition, text summarization, and inductive thematic analysis. Performance was assessed through comparisons between human coders and the machine coder. Result: GPT-4o performed well for most tasks but underperformed with identifying distinct digital well-being practices and their targeted harms. Alternative methods, including supervised learning, fine-tuning GPT, and active learning, are in development for the underperformed tasks. Among 1,000 randomly sampled news releases, 735 distinct digital well-being practices were identified. However, 32% lacked harm specification, and 81% had no evaluation plans. Most practices focus on content moderation and promoting positive content rather than addressing design features linked to user harms. The LLM pipeline refinement and analysis of remaining news releases are ongoing and will be updated soon. Implication: This study demonstrates the potential of LLMs in multidimensional content analysis and highlights the need for a harm-responsive approach to ensure platform interventions (1) address harmful design elements and (2) conduct systematic impact evaluation.","Yuning Liu, Emily Xing, Stanley Huang",Business meeting room,Hybrid Session,5,,620
