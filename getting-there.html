    <p>
      The central conference venue is the
      <a href="https://louisdegeer.se/">Louis de Geer concert and conference center</a> in the heart of Norrköping. It is located about 15 minutes by foot from the
      train station and most hotels that are located somewhere in the city.
      While you are at the conference, most amenities (the venue, hotels, cafes,
      and restaurants) are reachable by foot.

    <h2>Accessibility from Major European and US Cities</h2>

    <p>
      Norrköping is a mid-sized Swedish city which is highly accessible from
      major European and US cities. KLM flights connect the nearby Linköping airport
      to Amsterdam twice a day, and Linköping airport is only a 30 minute taxi
      ride from Norrköping. Stockholm-Arlanda has direct flights from all
      countries in Europe, and low-cost airlines (Easyjet, Vueling and Ryanair)
      operate direct connections from almost all European capitals. SAS and
      other airlines operate direct flights from both the East and West coast of
      the US, and from major cities in East Asia, North Africa, and the Middle
      East. The best way of travelling to Norrköping from Stockholm-Arlanda is
      by train (1.5h from central Stockholm and 2h from Arlanda airport).
    </p>

    <h2>Arrive via Plane and Train</h2>

    <p>
      Getting to Norrköping via plane and train is easy, since Norrköping is
      located on the highly-frequented North-South axis through Sweden. The
      central station is located close to the city center, meaning that most
      hotels, amenities, and the conference venue are reachable by foot.

      <summary><strong>From Stockholm Arlanda (ARN)</strong></summary>
      <p>
        After arriving at Stockholm Arlanda airport, there are two ways to get
        to Norrköping. The Swedish train company SJ operates direct connections
        between the stations Arlanda Central and Norrköping several times a day.
        You access the station Arlanda Central via "SkyCity". Present your
        ticket to the SJ staff at the gates to pass through.
        If none of the direct connections work for you, the second option is to
        take Arlanda Express to Stockholm Central station and then switch to an
        SJ InterCity train, or a Mälartåg regional train. Arlanda Express can be
        boarded at Arlanda Norra and Arlanda Södra by taking one of the yellow
        elevators. It takes 18 minutes to Stockholm Central. Both SJ InterCity
        and Mälartåg trains take about 60 to 90 minutes to Norrköping from
        Stockholm.

      <summary><strong>From Linköping City Airport (LPI)</strong></summary>
      <p>
        If you plan to arrive to Linköping City Airport, you are already very
        close to Norrköping. The easiest way forward is to take a Taxi to
        Norrköping, which takes about 30 minutes. There are also regional trains
        ("Östgötapendeln") that operate frequently between Linköping and
        Norrköping.

      <summary><strong>From Copenhagen Airport (CPH)</strong></summary>
      <p>
        If you plan to arrive from the South (including Hamburg or Malmö), you
        will need to take an X2000 intercity express train. The train starts in
        Malmö and takes about 3.5h to reach Norrköping on platform 7a. It
        frequents multiple times a day.
        Be aware that SJ currently does not serve the connection between
        Copenhagen and Malmö, so you will have to take an Öresundståg over the
        Öresunds-bridge and switch trains in Malmö.
      </p>

      <summary><strong>From Gothenburg Landvetter Airport (GOT)</strong></summary>
      <p>
        If your plane lands at the Landvetter Airport in Gothenburg, you will
        first need to take a bus from the airport to the city center. Several
        companies operate frequent connections. In Gothenburg, you will then
        take an SJ X2000 train to Katrineholm, and switch to a Mälartåg to
        Norrköping. This will take about 4h.

      <summary><strong>Arrive by Car</strong></summary>
      <p>
        If you plan on coming to Norrköping by car, you will have to find a spot.
        Norrköping has several parking garages that are reachable from the
        conference venue between 10 and 20 minutes by foot. It is also possible
        to park in some of the streets, although the maximum allowed parking
        time there is 24h. In addition, the municipality cleans the streets once
        a week during which parking is completely forbidden. This is indicated
        on the street signs.
