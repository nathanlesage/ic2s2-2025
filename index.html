          The International Conference for Computational Social Science (IC2S2)
          will be hosted by the
          <a href="https://liu.se/en/research/swecss">Swedish Excellence Center for Computational Social Science</a>
          and the
          <a href="https://liu.se/en/organisation/liu/iei/ias">Institute for Analytical Sociology</a>
          (IAS), Norrköping, Sweden, on July 22-24, 2025.
          IC2S2 has emerged as the dominant conference at the intersection of
          social and computational science, bringing together researchers from
          around the world in sociology, economics, political science,
          psychology, cognitive science, management, computer science,
          statistics and the full range of natural and applied sciences
          committed to understanding the social world through large-scale data
          and computation. IC2S2 is the annual conference of the
          <a href="https://iscss.org/">
            International Society for Computational Social Science.
          </a>
        </p>

        <p>
          The full-scale three-day conference (July 22-24) will feature research
          and researchers from around the world, across a broad range of
          relevant fields, and working on all areas of computational social
          science to advance its many frontiers. July 21 will be reserved for
          workshops and tutorials particularly targeted at early-career scholars.
        </p>

        <p>
          The IC2S2 community actively balances and maintains a conversation
          between social and computational scientists which integrates
          technological advances and opportunities with social scientific rigor
          and insight.
