      We are proud to announce that a number of travel grants are available to
      support attendees with limited travel resources.
    </p>

    <h2>Aim of Grants / Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      The grants aim to especially support attendees with limited travel
      resources and attendees from countries where computational social science
      is not yet well established.
    </p>

    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <p>
      To apply for the travel grant, please fill in this
      <a href="{{ site.data.travel_grants.application_form }}">travel grant application form</a>. You will be asked for some
      basic information, your abstract ID, a short statement as to why you would
      like to attend {{ site.title }} and how attendance will benefit your
      education/career, as well as a short statement describing your lack of
      financial support, and justifying your needs for the travel grant.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>
        The deadline for travel grant application submissions is {{ site.data.travel_grants.application_deadline }}.
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Notifications will be sent out on <strong>{{ site.data.travel_grants.grant_notification }}</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that there may be more meritorious applications than we will be able
      to award. In all cases, the grants and/or awards should be fully spent on
      the conference. Grants are awarded to attendants only upon providing
      receipts of expenses made in light of attending the conference. This is
      done in the month after the conference itself, and no deposits can be made
      beforehand.
