# IC<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>'25 Norrköping

> This is the Website source repository for the IC2S2 Conference in Norrköping
> in 2025.

Please see the [manual](./MANUAL.md) for a guide of how to take this repository
and adapt it for the upcoming editions of IC2S2 in the future. This repository
should be a living document that improves with each conference.

> [!NOTE]
> We have had a hand-off meeting between IC2S2 2025 and IC2S2 2026 in August
> 2025. The next organizers have taken over the responsibility for further
> developing this repository. Thus, please head over to their repository at
> [Vermont-Complex-Systems/ic2s2-2026](https://github.com/Vermont-Complex-Systems/ic2s2-2026)
> to view the most up-to-date version of this code. The organizers of IC2S2 2027
> should fork their repository, not ours.
