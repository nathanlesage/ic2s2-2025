				<h6>Call for Abstracts</h6>

				<p>
					The International Conference on Computational Social Science (IC2S2) is the premier conference bringing together researchers from different disciplines interested in using computational and data-intensive methods to address relevant societal problems. IC2S2 hosts academics and practitioners in computational science, social science, complexity, and network science, and provides a platform for new research in the field of computational social science.
				</p>

				<h6>Submission instructions</h6>

				<p>
					Submissions are in the form of extended abstracts (max 2 pages) in PDF format, formatted according to the official
					<a href="files/ic2s2_2025_latex_template.zip">LaTeX</a>
					or
					<a href="files/ic2s2_2025_word_template.docx">MS Word</a>
					templates that can be downloaded from the submission website.
					The submission should include a title, a list of 5 keywords, and an extended abstract (serving as the main text of the submission). The abstract should outline the impact of the work, along with (if relevant) the main theoretical contribution, data and methods used, and findings. Authors are strongly encouraged to include figures and/or tables in their submission (note that figures will not count towards the page limit). Submitted abstracts will undergo a double-blind review process. Therefore, abstracts must be anonymized: do not include the author(s) names or affiliation(s) in the paper, and do not include funding or other acknowledgments. When submitting, authors will be also asked to provide a short summary paragraph that will be used during the review bidding phase. Submissions that violate these guidelines will be automatically rejected.
				</p>

				<p>
					Submissions will be non-archival, and thus the presented work can be already published, in preparation for publication elsewhere, or ongoing research. Abstracts will be reviewed by multiple members of a Program Committee composed of experts in computational social science. The accepted contributions will be selected for one of the following presentations: (i) a lightning talk (~6 mins) in a plenary session, (ii) an oral presentation in parallel tracks (~15 mins), or (iii) a poster presentation session. Lightning talks will be preferentially assigned to those requesting this form of presentation at submission and to early career researchers. In order to be included in the program, at least one of the authors must register for the conference by the early-bird registration deadline.
				</p>

				<h6>Topics</h6>

				<p>
					We welcome submissions on any topic in the field of computational social science, including (a) work that advances methods and approaches for computational social science, (b) data-driven work that describes and discovers social and cultural phenomena or explains and estimates relations between them and other things, and (c) theoretical work that generates new insights, connections and frameworks for computational social science research. Researchers across disciplines, faculty, graduate students, industry researchers, policy makers, and nonprofit workers are all encouraged to submit computational data-driven research and innovative computational methodological or theoretical contributions on social phenomena for consideration.
