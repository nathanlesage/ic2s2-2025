					The conference will be organized by the Swedish Excellence Center for
					Computational Social Science at the Institute for Analytical Sociology
					in Norrköping, Sweden.

				<p>
					Nestled in the bay of Bråviken on the Baltic Sea, Norrköping
					(population: 150,000) was once the hub of Sweden's 19th and 20th
					century textile industry. The industrial heritage is visible in the
					unusually well-preserved industrial landscape. As a UNESCO City of
					Music, Norrköping has resurged as a center of music and the arts.
				</p>

				<p>
					The conference venue is the Louis de Geer concert and conference
					center (pictured above), featuring a large auditorium, several
					conference rooms, and a spacious atrium. The conference center is
					centrally located in the industrial landscape, the old industrial
					area at the heart of Norrköping. In between canals and waterfalls,
					the area, once dominated by paper and textile industries, today hosts
					a university campus, startup firms, museums, and restaurants. The
					center, which is also the home to the Norrköping Symphony Orchestra,
					was built into the structure of a 1950s paper mill.
				</p>

				<p>
					The conference venue is surrounded by various landmarks worth a visit.
					The <a href="https://www.norrkopingskonstmuseum.se/in-english/" rel="nofollow">Norrköping Art Museum</a> hosts one of the country's most celebrated
					collections of Swedish modernism and contemporary art. The <a href="https://www.arbetetsmuseum.se/praktisk-information/information-in-english/" rel="nofollow">Museum of
					Work</a> collects people’s stories for multi-media portrays of work and
					everyday life in industrializing Sweden. The <a href="https://visualiseringscenter.se/en/" rel="nofollow">Visualization Center C</a>
					combines cutting-edge visualization research with public outreach
					activities. It hosts an interactive exhibition, media labs, and an
					immersive 3D fulldome theatre. The Knäppingsborg area offers lively
					cafés, gourmet restaurants, and artisanal boutiques in 5 min walking
					distance from the venue. The city center is 10 minutes away by foot
					and offers shops, kiosks, supermarkets, and restaurants at various
					price levels.
