					The conference will be held at the Swedish Excellence Center for
					Computational Social Science at the Institute for Analytical Sociology
					in Norrköping, Sweden.

					Nestled in the bay of Bråviken on the Baltic Sea, Norrköping
					(population: 150,000) was once the hub of Sweden's 19th and 20th
					century textile industry. The industrial heritage is visible in the
					unusually well-preserved industrial landscape. As a UNESCO City of
					Music, Norrköping has resurged as a center of music and the arts.

					The conference venue is the
					<a href="https://louisdegeer.se/">Louis de Geer concert hall</a>
					(pictured above), featuring a large auditorium, several conference
					rooms, and a spacious atrium.
